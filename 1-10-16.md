This is the first entry in the markdown lab notebook, we are going to see if we like it.  First thing to do is check the temperatures and the pressures.  Of course this can also be seen on [LettSpinorLab](http://lettspinorlab.github.io/) live.  Everything looks good in terms of the circulator outside.

|  Time | Pressure  | Ion Current  |T2   | T3  | T4|T5|T6|T7|T8|T9|T10|T11
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|11:08a |1.8E-8|2.0E-5|92.0|111.3|92.5|111.7|108.3|69.0|91.3|60.2|59.7|102.9|

I did not change any of the variacs.  For the rest of the day, I will figure out how to get this lab notebook operational and also work on my simulations.  When I make more measurements, I will add them to the above table.

Today I again checked the temperature and pressure, the temperatures were the same as before, but the Pressure was 1.7E-8 and the ion pump current was 2.6E-5 at 9:31am.
