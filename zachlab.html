<h1 id="1102016">1/10/2016</h1>

<p>This is the first entry in the markdown lab notebook, we are going to see if we like it.  First thing to do is check the temperatures and the pressures.  Of course this can also be seen on <a href="http://lettspinorlab.github.io/">LettSpinorLab</a> live.  Everything looks good in terms of the circulator outside.</p>

<p>I did not change any of the variacs.  For the rest of the day, I will figure out how to get this lab notebook operational and also work on my simulations.  When I make more measurements, I will add them to the above table.</p>



<h1 id="1112016">1/11/2016</h1>

<p>Today I again checked the temperature and pressure, the temperatures were the same as before, but the Pressure was 1.7E-8 and the ion pump current was 2.6E-5 at 9:31am.  </p>



<h4 id="105004-11012016">10:50:04-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now we will be aligning the sfg system. </p>



<h4 id="131359-11012016">13:13:59-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>We have plugged all the laser power cords into the blue plugs.  Now I will align the TA.  Some notes for setting up the NPPhotonics fiber laser </p>

<ul>
<li>Must select FLM-0107</li>
<li>Must select Rev B</li>
</ul>

<p>After turning on the laser,, we didn’t see any power, so changed fibers to one with green tips on it, PM90-XP.  We were previously using blue tipped fiber.  Output at first is 49.31mW. </p>



<h4 id="163545-11012016">16:35:45-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Aligning the SFG system.  First thing to do is align the Tapered Amplifier.  The light comes out of the fiber laser, goes through an isolator and two lenses before being steered in to the amplifier.  </p>



<h4 id="182125-11012016">18:21:25-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Brian gave me some tips on starting up the TA, I am going to copy them into this document.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check your TA chip is OK by diode testing it. It should have a normal diode voltage drop in one direction and infinite resistance in the other direction</li>
<li>Mount the chip. The mount has x, y and z degrees of freedom. To change x, loosen the bolts through to the base and slide the mount. To change y, add aluminum foil underneath the mount. To change z, rotate the threaded lens mount.</li>
<li>Connect the current controller and temp controller. Set the temp controller at about 20C. Put the current controller at 0A.</li>
<li>For a 2W chip, do not go above 400mA without properly seeding the laser. Also avoid seeding the TA for long times without running current through the TA. Check the manufacturer spec for the max seed. Eagleyard should be 50mW max. We use 30-35mW usually. <br>
<ul><li>Adjust the spontaneous emission. It should be going straight backwards from the mount and level to the table.</li>
<li>Collimate the beam by using the lens mount z adjustment. It will probably have a wide horizontal halo. Ignore that and make the center bright part collimated.</li>
<li>Bring in your seed beam to the TA. It should be mode matched (collimated and the same size as the back reflection).</li></ul></li>
<li>You should be seeding the laser at this point. Optimize the output power at 400mA      current. You should aim for &gt;10mW output. Yes, you are getting out less than you put in.</li>
<li>Before doing any experiment (or anything with a potential for back reflection), put in an optical isolator. You will need it!</li>
<li>Carefully increase the current and plot the output power versus current. The curve will level off somewhere. Stop increasing current when it starts to level off. This is your max current.</li>
<li>The output spatial mode will look terrible. Good luck shaping it. If you’re putting it into a fiber, be careful not to burn the fiber. The TA spatial mode is a function of current, so you will need to constantly realign as you turn the TA current up.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended that a piece of the TA input seed and output power is simultaneously put into a fabry perot to determine if there the TA is causing feedback to the seed. An optical isolator on the input seed may be necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, very useful paper by Dan Steck <a href="http://steck.us/papers/ta.pdf">Steck TA paper</a></p>



<h1 id="1122016">1/12/2016</h1>

<p>I am trying to figure out how well my simulations compare to each other .  I have three types of simulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>coherent state evolution</li>
<li>fock state evolution</li>
<li>mean field</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now the mean field and fock state simulations comprae well, I think the issue is that the coherent evolution uses parameters which need to be scaled by factors of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1">\pi</script>.  I belive the correct scaling is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2">4 \pi c</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-3">c</script> is the dynamical evolution rate.</p>

<p>The public access to the program will be through a script which does all of the conversions, so users should not have to worry about this.  Right now I am working with simulations of about 5000 atoms as it is inconvenient to run coherent simulations for larger atom numbers.  I will run a large simulation while I try to align the TA and check back after lunch.</p>



<h4 id="102247-12012016">10:22:47-12/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now I am working on aligning the TA using instructions from yesterday.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wired up the temperature PID circuit and set it to 18.2 C.</li>
<li>TA current turned on, no spontaneous emission.  Checked connections and tried again, still no emission.  Need to turn off lights probably.  Turned off lights, weak emission, but there.</li>
<li>Moved mirrors back and aligned two pinholes to align beam from fiber laser into TA.</li>
</ol>



<h4 id="182337-12012016">18:23:37-12/01/2016</h4>

<p>TA is aligned and with minimal effor have 4mW of output power.  Going to mess with the telescope lense setup to try to optimze this.  Had to take the second lens off of a stage to get it to the right height.  Arne had the last two mirrors lower the light, I moved everything down to the same level.  We have 4.5 mw of power, lets turn up the power and see what we have.  We have put on the attenutator, so our initial reading is different</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we will optimize the beampath more, this is a bit lower than Arne measured on 06/28/2013, but not too bad.</p>



<h1 id="1132016">1/13/2016</h1>

<p>Played around with commenting the simulation code this morning, using a linter which enforces style guidelines, should make it easier for other people to use.</p>



<h4 id="100816-13012016">10:08:16-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Everything looks good with regards to temperature, pressure, and logging software.  Going to optimize the TA.  I moved the mirrors to be closer to the TA and re-aligned completely to save some space on the table.  I swapped out the mount for the second lens for a micrometer so I can do some finer adjustments.</p>



<h4 id="121616-13012016">12:16:16-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>TA is now partially aligned, after lunch I will get the power up.  Acquired GPIB to usb cable to hook up SRS630 thermocouple monitor to the computer for the bake. </p>



<h4 id="125647-13012016">12:56:47-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Got it back to where it was yesterday.  Will continue trying to optimize, then I will make a measurement of the power as a function of TA current.  </p>

<p>I have optimized as much as I could.  Power measured beyond TA with the FieldMate is 3.02mW with  ~29mW of input seed.  I now put in the optical isolator with 74% efficiency.    This isn’t great, I think I will tweak it up later.</p>

<p>Now we will make the power measurement:</p>

<p>This is not enough power, so we will optimize more at low power.  Power optimized.  When we set up the optics for the innolight laser we will need to partially re-align anyway.  </p>



<h4 id="141734-13012016">14:17:34-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now I will get the SRS630 thermocouple reader working.  It will interface with the same python program to push data to website.  </p>

<p>The reader is working and the data is now being stored on an influxdb/grafana workflow which is accessbile at <a href="jqi-logger.physics.umd.edu">JQI-Logger</a> which is a JQI wide timeseries monitoring database setup.  I will not keep passwords here, but there is a Python API for InfluxDB which allows easy data mongering.  </p>

<p>I screwed up when loading the old data into the database and converted timezones wrong, so the old data is recorded as six hours earlier than it actually is.  </p>



<h1 id="1142016">1/14/2016</h1>

<p>Today I will get the rest of the SFG system going as well as wipe and clean the old analysis computer to be used as a monitoring computer to free up serial ports on the laptop.</p>

<p>Cleaned up the SpinorBEC panel on Grafana so it now displays relevent statistics.</p>



<h4 id="101330-14012016">10:13:30-14/01/2016</h4>

<p>Need to properly optimize the two isolators in the TA part of the SFG system.  Aligning an isolator requires the following steps from the <a href="http://www.ofr.com/io_alignment.htm">OFR Website</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Remove protective tape from polatizor cells.</li>
<li>Place the isoltaor in the laser beam.  Place a detector &gt; 8” from the ouput polarizer.  Center the beam.</li>
<li>Loosen set screws on the polarizer cells.</li>
<li>Rotate the input polariztor until transmission is maximzed, thus aligning it to the laser’s plane of polarization.  Lock down its set screw.</li>
<li>Rotate the output polarizer until the transmission is maximized.  This should occur at 45 relative to the input plane of polarization.</li>
<li>Reverse the isolator and put the detector a few inches from the input polarizer.  Center the beam.</li>
<li>Adjust the output polarizer until the transmission is minimized (should only be 1-2 degrees).</li>
<li>Return the isolator to operating position.  Should now be ready to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>The model of isolators and expected transmission we are using are: <br>
* <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=4915">ThorLabs IO-2.5-1064-VLP</a>, expected transmission is 75% <br>
* EOT Isolator, expected transmission &gt; 90%</p>

<p>Had group meeting and lunch.  Removed the EOT isolator and am going to try to optimize TA again.   </p>

<p>Wrote documentation for the Simulation code I wrote as <a href="https://github.com/ZachGlassman/SpinorBECSimulation">Simulation Code</a>.</p>



<h4 id="193942-14012016">19:39:42-14/01/2016</h4>

<p>Aligned the TA again from scratch fixing the height.  </p>

<p>It turns out the system works better if the lenses are closer together than would be expected, however, at 401mW, I now have 6.3mW.  I am going to take data to see the trend.</p>

<p>I am going to tweak it up and bit, then call it for the night.</p>



<h1 id="1192016">1/19/2016</h1>

<p>Working on simulations to compare with Ryan.  For now I am <em>faking</em> negative q by using an imaginary magnetic field since <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-4">q</script> is just the term which is quadratic in the magnetic field.  This works as long as there is no linear shift.  Eventually it will be better to just work in terms of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5">q</script> anyway or at least be able to.</p>



<h4 id="104828-19012016">10:48:28-19/01/2016</h4>

<p>Alinging the TA.  At 400mA, I get about 7mW out of the TA.  I am going to try to make this better.  Not able to do much better in a short time. </p>

<p>Preparing for meeting with Ryan Wilson about the spinor evolution.</p>



<h4 id="165458-19012016">16:54:58-19/01/2016</h4>

<p>Had a long chat with Ryan Wilson, found that calculation for q was incorrect by factor of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6">(2\pi)^3</script> which is probably a momentum space integral.  Our calculations agree except for that.  I need to prepare plots of :</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial state distribution for truncated wigner</li>
<li>Long time evolution of coherent state.</li>
<li>Full simulation for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7">q=-5</script> </li>
</ul>

<p>Prepared these plots, they are shown below.  The first is the intial disttribution for TWA at 10k atoms and the second is a simulation of 10k atoms for -5q.  I think there might be a slight issue with the initial state preparation since the simulations should agree slightly better.</p>

<h1 id="1202016">1/20/2016</h1>

<p>Today I will try to do several things: <br>
* Make progress on cluster computations <br>
* Get TA aligned with new waveplate (should help power) <br>
* Set up temperature monitoring of the lab through Rasberry pi or arduino.</p>



<h4 id="110759-20012016">11:07:59-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>Set up the temperature monitor for the room with an arduino and an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1782">Adafruit MPC9808</a>.  </p>

<p>I now have cluster access to Deepthought2 and am going to spend the rest of the morning trying to get that working.</p>



<h4 id="142213-20012016">14:22:13-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>I put in the waveplate for the TA which helped the power a bit.  However, the power was wandering around by about .2mW over a timescale of minutes so I adjusted the telescope to see if I could improve that.  The output power at 400mA current is about 8mW now.</p>

<p>I took off the attenuator to get a better measurement and the TA is aligned to 10.8mW.  We are ready to proceed.  </p>

This should be good enough.</p>



<h4 id="165842-20012016">16:58:42-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have done everything I set out to do today.  I also ran a long time simulation is show below. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kJ0DHfKi52M/VqADNH-r4nI/AAAAAAAAG-8/S6_kPOqHBhE/s0/figure_1.png" alt="enter image description here" title="longtime1-20.png"></p>

<p>What is perhaps interesting is that both the single fock state and the TWA are great approximations for some period of time, but they each fail at long times.  It seems like only an incomplete description is needed for the first few oscillations.  This is quite good as it means we may not need a full cluster simulation even if the TWA does not work.</p>



<h1 id="1212016">1/21/2016</h1>

<p>Today I need to sort out my schedule for next semester and get the lab ready for the big snow storm.</p>

<p>Group meeting this morning with presentation by Carla about Quantum Imaging.</p>



<h4 id="123008-21012016">12:30:08-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>Hooked up thermocouple to the ion pump below the magnets which should give us an idea of the maximum temperature of the magnets.  It is something like 40 celsius.  So this should not be an issue at all.  As always ones can view the status at <a href="http://jqi-logger.physics.umd.edu/dashboard/db/spinorbec">JQI Logger</a>.  </p>



<h4 id="161731-21012016">16:17:31-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>Optimized the isolator at full 2A, was already close to what it should be.  Then re-aligned the TA at 2A.  The TA alignment is <em>strongly</em> dependant on the input current, thus final alignments must be done at full power.  I found I had to increase the distance between the telescope lens pair prior to the TA at 2A compared to 400mA.  </p>

<p>The procedure to align the isolator was to rotate the magnetic body until the part of the input beam reflected off the beam splitter on the input side from the incoming beam was minimized.  We will keep the TA alignment as is (~820 mW @ 2A with isolator) for now.</p>

<p>Next we will put in a prism pair and a spacial filter for beam shaping and cleaning.  The prism pair changes the beam height and it is not parallel to the table anymore.  The angle is between 1 and 2 degrees from the horizontal.</p>



<h4 id="192135-21012016">19:21:35-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have fixed this and put in the spatial filter, tomorrow I will align the spatial fiter.</p>

<p>I have updated the Fock State simulation by adding an adaptive stepsize ‘zvode’ method as opposed to a very simple fourth order Runge-Kutta method.  This should alleviate the need to choose a correct step size.  The advantage seems to be that there is no need to choose the step size and there is a benefit when using large atom numbers (&gt;25k), however at smaller atom numbers it seems to do many more steps than the really quite basic fourth order method I already implemented without any noticible increase in error.  At very small atom numbers, it also does better.  </p>

<p>The conclusion is that for any particular time step one chooses with the basic method there is a maximum atom number for which the propogation does not go unstable and a region where it is also faster than an adaptive time step method.  The adaptive time step is always stable, but can take longer times for some atom numbers.  I will have to do more testing, but it could be that using the adaptive algorithm is not as good as optimzing the step for a specific number.  This is unlike the TWA code in which the adaptive step size gave significant performance benefits.</p>



<h1 id="1222016">1/22/2016</h1>

<p>It is snowing, so I am working today on my simulations an attempting to get them to run on the cluster.  Unfortunately, my simulations rely on numba, which is a JIT compiler targeting llvm relying on a more updated version of python than is on the cluster.  I have spoken to the cluster admin to see if they can upgrade python, but for today, I will work on removing the dependancy. </p>



<h4 id="102300-22012016">10:23:00-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>Most of the time in the code is spend calculating the tridiagonal Hamtilonian for each <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">k</script> in the number of pairs basis at each time step.  This is done through a function called tri_ham which is written in a optimized for the JIT compiler, although also works without it.  I have profiled the function with and without the compiler to get </p>

<p>This the JIT gives a speedup of ~350 times.  Thus not using the compiler will render the code essentially useless.  For reference, here is the function we are considering</p>

<p>The goal for right now is to see if I can implement this same functionality using numpy such that I don’t lost speed and can then run easily on the supercomputer.  The dependencies are currently</p>

<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>numba</li>
<li>sys</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>tqdm</li>
<li>scipy</li>
</ul>

<p>However, all but numpy and scipy could be removed easily if I can get this function to be faster.</p>

<p>One preliminary solution has been obtained, which runs in 1.45ms, thus only a factor of 2-3 times slower than the JIT compiled code and only has numpy dependency.  </p>



<h4 id="123904-22012016">12:39:04-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>We also need to change the functions which compute expection values in a similiar manner.  For reference, here is the fast numpy only code for computing the tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements.</p>

<p>All code seems to produce equivalent answers and is certainly equivalent mathematically, however, it appears that there is some difference due to machine precision.  After some testing, it appears this difference is acceptable.  </p>

<p>The top graph is both evolutions over time for 4000 atoms and the bottom is a histogram of the error.  Since the error is in the 1e-11 range as compared to populations of thousands, this is perfectly acceptable.</p>



<h4 id="132413-22012016">13:24:13-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>This code is now ready to run on the cluster.  The only further optimization that could be done is to use a faster numerical integration algorithm.  I will spend a bit investigating the scipy ode library to see if I can improve this.</p>



<h4 id="163916-22012016">16:39:16-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have finished with the code for the cluster, my first try is run a bunch of separate fock state simulations with different <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-10">q</script> to see if anything interesting comes up, and then compare to the mean field at these values.  Using the cluster is somewhat difficult, but I will share what I have learned so far</p>

<ul>
<li>To submit a bunch of jobs, use the bash scripting language to loop over the job submission command.</li>
<li>Python support on the cluster is very poor, I will need to work on installing packages myself, however, I found that by loading the module in the workspace, I was able to more easily load the modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>I ran seven jobs and used 18 seconds of total computing time.  None of them worked completely as I still have not gotten the syntax down.  I believe it has to do with using outdated packages.  I have put in a request for the IT division to update the python packages.  I will be trying more soon.</p>

<p>I will set up some simulations to run on my work computer over the weekend.</p>



<h1 id="1252016">1/25/2016</h1>

<p>Worked on merging the lab notebooks, spent most of the day shoveling my car out of storm Jonas.  Started running simulation for full 40k atoms, should finish by tomorrow.  Also go an email that the cluster is updating the python distribution in the next week or so.  Should be good to run soon.</p>



<h1 id="1262016">1/26/2016</h1>

<p>Finished the full simulation for 40k atoms, the results are here <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lWmkdKHVC30/Vqee96U3NvI/AAAAAAAAHA4/1nmRMDTu02A/s0/40k1s.png" alt="enter image description here" title="40k1s.png"></p>

<p>Compared to the 10k simulation, the fock state and hte coherent state agreement is much better.  The averaging here is not so good (mag, atom loop only 5) so it would be nice to see after a cluster run if averaging over more states helped.  This simulation took ~23 hours so it would not be feasible to run anything larger on my desk computer.</p>



<h4 id="165351-26012016">16:53:51-26/01/2016</h4>

<p>Wrote the fock state simulation in C++, getting about 15-25% speed improvments which is quite good.</p>

<p>The cluster website is down, but I am attempting to run some code on it.  </p>



<h4 id="171844-26012016">17:18:44-26/01/2016</h4>

<p>First successful cluster run.  Issue was module python must be loaded before the application is run.  First run took 2:23 and it worked.  I will start thinking about the best way to continue using it.  </p>

<p>After all day, I used an additional 5:35 of computing time.  Now that I have the system figured out, I will set up a longer simulation before running more code.</p>



<h1 id="1292016">1/29/2016</h1>

<p>I have been working on the DAMOP abstract for the past few days in addition to collecting data on the spinor simulations.  I will present some of the hightlights here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed coherent state and fock state simulation agreement, which is now quite excellent as shown in the following plot<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IoN-o9jTwjE/Vqu5ddV2mrI/AAAAAAAAHJA/SmT2av9IDJg/s0/comparefock_coh.png" alt="enter image description here" title="comparefock_coh.png">  This plot also shows the current issue which is not yet resolved, namely that the TWA simulations (designated as mean field here) are not in great agreement.  Really, they should match almost exactly for at least a period.</li>
<li>Ran simulations for the microwave reversal pulses in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-11">F=1</script> condensate.  These did produce some nice results. <br>

<p>I am going to work on aligning the spatial filter after the prism pair.  the biggest issue that the beam is not parallel to the table, I am hoping it is close enough that the spatial filtering is useful.  Procedure will be :</p>

<ol>
<li>Align the beam through the stage without the lens or the pinhole installed. </li>
<li>Install the lens and align to the beam.</li>
<li>Insert the pinhole past the focus of the lens and align.</li>
</ol>

<p>I changed the stage of the prism pair so that it is better supported.</p>

<p>The morning I did some simulations for Don to compare his results with and went to the JQI seminar.  Now back to aligning the repump laser system.  I have put in a Melles Griot prism pair which is causing some issues, I am going to change the mount on the spatial filter to one which is height adjustable and hope this helps.</p>



<h4 id="144230-01022016">14:42:30-01/02/2016</h4>

<p>I changed the mount on the spatial filter and modified the assembly for the prism pair which seems to help significantly.  The issue is that the height of the beam is so low that I cannot use an adjustable base, so I can only add small spacers to make the height changes.</p>

<p>We do not have any of the correct microscope objectives for this wavelength, so we will proceed without the spatial filter and then put it in retroactively.  </p>

<p>I need to expand and collimate the beam coming out of the innolight laser.  According to Don’s notebook I need 2.152A to get lasing.</p>

<p>Everything is aligned, I need to find a power meter so I can optimize the waveplates and the isolator.  then I should be able to send everything into the fiber.</p>



<h1 id="222016">2/2/2016</h1>

<p>Looking into the code for our data monitoring, I would like to make a few improvments, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Within each process thread which runs analysis scripts, spawn new process to leverage cpu cores better.  Cap number of running processes and make sure they actually end.  Possibly use zprocess (from Lincoln Turner’s group)</li>
<li>Abstract routines making them easier to write (some ideas on this below)</li>
<li>Switch to hdf5 file format for saving images with run information</li>
<li>Set up local server to store non-image data (save path to images in database, file system is correct place to store image data)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some thoughts on routine abstractions: <br>
A routine is composed of three tasks: <br>
1. Aquiring data and parameters <br>
2. Performing actions aquired data and parameters <br>
3. Returning results</p>

<p>The main thread should not care or know about anything to do with 2 and only needs to know a priori about the type of results returned.  Lets make the further limiting assumption that data will always be in the form on a numpy array (numerical values) in some dimension and that parameters can be represented as a dictionary.    </p>

<p>So we have a Procedure class which needs to expose to the GUI the input parameters and their types and the return dictionary with types.  Lets also assume for now that the return dictionary will be composed of parameters bound to numerical arrays.  </p>

<p>Parameters need to be divided into user input and program input, by this I mean input that needs to come directly from the user (although can and will be initialized with reasonable defaults) such as fitting parameters as opposed to parameters that come from the program such as index name.  </p>

<p>User will generate procedure objects in one of two ways: <br>
1. Subclassing Procedure and adding things themselves (probably preferred way for control) <br>
2. Creating routine for data processing and using helper functions within Procedure class to instantiate without subclassing</p>

<p>User will be able to specify procedures to load in the configuration procedure on start, or load them in dynamically.</p>

<p>We have some issues with the SFG system alignment, namely that we need more room to put in the telescope system and the spatial filter system.  The problem is that the heights of the TA and the innolight laser are not the same, so the beams must be raised and lowered. </p>

<p>I am moving the TA back a few inches and re-aligning it so we can have the option of putting in a spatial filter later.  Doing same alignment procedure as before, I have not touched anything until the mirrors before the TA, so the lens pair and isolator should still be aligned.</p>

<p>Moved everything back and have the TA producing power, but not very much.  Need to tweak it up for the rest of the day. </p>



<h4 id="161936-02022016">16:19:36-02/02/2016</h4>

<p>Back aligned, getting 992 mA at 2A of current.  Put in the lens system to alter the beam diameter into the fiber.  </p>

<p>Now I am using a power meter to optimize the waveplate-isolator-waveplate grouping after the innolight laser for maximum power.  Borrowed it from Gretchen’s Strontium lab, they need it back before tomorrow morning.  Its not rated for the right wavelength, but it gives me some very insensitive measurement.  Its good enough to align the isolator.</p>

<p>The system relies on a dichroic optic which transmits 1319nm and reflects 1064nm light, however, there is some reflection from the 1319nm beam on the first setup attempt.  This is probably because the optic needs to be at 45 degrees and it is not.  I will adjust the optic until the reflection is minimal and then realign other beam path. <br>
The following is the properties of the mirror we are using</p>

<p>The temperature control has been really poor in the lab the last few days, and we are currently having yet another temperature event.  This could be because it is unseasonably warm outside.</p>

<p>Hooking up the temperature control unit for the SFG crystal, it requires a cable of a farily normal variety.  I will try to find the exact one we used to sue although I am pretty sure it has no special nature.</p>

<p>Talked with Don and we realized the intitial phase for the TWA simulations we have been running is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-12">\pi</script>.  I want to check and make sure this is consistent with the full quantum simulations.</p>

<p>A few things to do in the Experiment Monitor: <br>
* Clean up the names of the files, make them uniform and sensible <br>
* Change the DataTable class implementation to make it faster by using more of a MVC framework on the dataframe at the heart of the experiment.  Also, have a slider which populates the rows as its slid, starting with the latest maybe 20 shots.  Problem with performance when displaying table with 500+ rows and many columns. <br>
* Integrate database (possible SQLlite) <br>
* Write tests as much as possible</p>

<p>I have changed the implementation of the data processing.  Before I used a multi-threading approach which allowed did not lock up the central GUI thread while running some analysis procedure (ex. image fit).  However, this does not take advantage of multi-core cpu as the GIL in python prevents more than one thread from executing at once in the same python process.  However, the threads execute asynchronously, so to the user it appears as if the GUI is fully responsive.  This is probably good enough for our purposes, but in case we ever want to run multi analysis routines on each image or do some particularly fancy stuff, I have modified it so each routine is offloaded to a new separate python process, which can run on other cores (this is scheduled by the operatoring system).  There is some cost due to the overhead of starting a new process, but this is well under a second.  The procedure now works like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Image comes in and processing is moved to a new processing thread. </li>
<li>From the processing thread, a new python process is initated for each Procedure to be run on the image.</li>
<li>The results from each procedure are returned to the processing thread.</li>
<li>The processing thread sends the results to the main thread.</li>
<li>The processing thread destroys itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>This system is optimized for our experiment which has a cycle time of 20s.  In this regime, we don’t care about the startup time associated with spawning new processes, but we do care about the true parallelism they offer.</p>



<h4 id="110534-03022016">11:05:34-03/02/2016</h4>

<p>Rob came by from facilities management.  I have given him the following temperature plot <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DdBZamRpjbU/VrIlRzeIOPI/AAAAAAAAHLc/Rd6VbDhCwOI/s0/labtemp.png" alt="enter image description here" title="labtemp.png"></p>

<p>He has several possible solutions, some which involve changing the settings for the room, others which involve setting up a fourth temperature sensor.  Right now the temperature of the room is controlled by reading three temperature sensors, all on the wall with the computer controls and averaging them to set the properties of the three air handling units in the room.  We may install a fourth sensor near the lasers which will also be averaged.</p>

<p>I am also re-organizing some of the boxes that contain parts for the move since it was quite inefficient to find the temperature control cable for the SFG system.</p>



<h4 id="144544-03022016">14:45:44-03/02/2016</h4>

<p>Fibers are all in place to align the SFG system.  I am using a fiber aligner and will align in a few steps: <br>
1. Align the output of the TA into the fiber with (~100mW of power, 800mA of current) and fix the position of the dichroic. <br>
2. Align the innolight into the fiber without touching dichroic alignment. <br>
3. Optimize fiber for both power and then connect SFG.</p>



<h4 id="164643-03022016">16:46:43-03/02/2016</h4>

<p>There is 64mW before the fiber (with attenuator on), although not sure how much of that is TEM<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-13">_{00}</script>.  After the fiber, there is 5.3 mW after some alignment.  I will try to tweak that up now.</p>

<p>I am going to lower the power to 6.7mW (500 mA) which will allow me to not need to use the attenuator. This way I can find the optimal efficiency of the fiber at low power.  Then I can turn up the power.  The issue is that right now I am putting the measurement device right after the fiber, however, when I use the attenuater, much of the light from the fiber is lost.  </p>

<p>I was going to also use the OPHIR power meter, which can handle larger powers (up to 300W), but unfortunately, it does not work anymore.  </p>

<p>I have optimized the ouput to 18% efficiency through the fiber.  This is not necessarily unexpected, however, I want to check with some other people before continuing.  This could be correct because we know the TA output has terrible mode quality.  Steck <em>et al</em> report efficiencies of aroudn 25-35%.  However, Meng has reported efficiency of around 57%.  </p>



<h4 id="195524-03022016">19:55:24-03/02/2016</h4>

<p>I want to think about some of the things the ExperimentMonitor program will need to handle.  Identifying a few points necessary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take data for a week straight.</li>
<li>Take data every 10 seconds</li>
<li>Display plots of data live</li>
</ul>

<p>So to take data for a week straight at 10 seconds per data point means the program will need to handle 60480 shots ( 1week*s/week * 1shot/second).  Each datum is approximately 1mb, so we will need approximately 60 Gb of disk space, this is totally acceptable on the lab computers which have hard drives on the order of terabytes.  </p>

<p>Making the assumption that we will record 100 <em>things</em> for each shot, where each thing is a floating point number, we will need to have a pandas DataFrame which has 60480 * 100 elements.  This is less than 50mb and should not be a problem.</p>

<p>In terms of plotting, I have timed plotting of a single data series in two different and found the following results.  The label <em>to numpy</em> means the dataseries was cast to a numpy array before plotting and the label pandas means it was plotted using the native pandas functionality.  The filled lines are standard deviations taken from 10 separate trials.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Rs4eikU1H48/VrKwq3mPEyI/AAAAAAAAHL0/5Ss2-gM3e8U/s0/numpyvspandas.png" alt="enter image description here" title="numpyvspandas.png"></p>

<p>Clearly the version which goes to a numpy array is much faster than the native pandas version.  The speed of the faster version is quite good, the second plot shows a zoomed in version of the mean values of the to numpy version.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T7gZhCo2rHs/VrKwvfSizcI/AAAAAAAAHL8/qKF8if49E-U/s0/numpyvspandas2.png" alt="enter image description here" title="numpyvspandas2.png"></p>

<p>Even for the most possible data points, the plot takes at most 10 ms, which means that 100 plots can be updated in a second.  This is acceptable performance wise, although I may move the plotting to a separate thread to make GUI not lock ever!  </p>

<p>Note that some of the plots are drawn using pyqtgraph which is faster still.  In addition, this timing includes figure creation which will add some time compared to updating the plots in the application.</p>



<h4 id="205928-03022016">20:59:28-03/02/2016</h4>

<p>More thoughts on implementation details <br>
* Perhaps plot directly from the dataframe convenience commands <br>
* Add some sort of experiment category instead of just day by day <br>
* Create plot manager on separate thread (could be QObject) which manages all plots on separate thread and gets sent updated dataframe on each shot.  <br>
*  Possibly move the ignore shots commands out of visual plotter and into another section so the plotting does not need to worry about this and it can be done in the DataFrame itself.</p>



<h1 id="242016">2/4/2016</h1>

<p>Today I want to get the SFG system all going.  I also need to meet with Arne regarding some simulation stuff he has done.</p>



<h4 id="101532-04022016">10:15:32-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>Currently, I don’t have any power meters which can measure at 1319nm (more accurately, I don’t have any heads), so I will see how sensitive our power meter is at this wavelength.  It may be good enough to optimize the fiber alignment, even if we don’t know exactly how much power we are sending through.  Unfortunately, our power meter (fieldmate) has no sensitivity in that regime which not surprising.  I will need to borrow a head to do this properly.</p>



<h4 id="105220-04022016">10:52:20-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>I have aligned the innolight into the fiber as best as I can without a power measurement.  After group meeting, I will attempt to find a device sensitive at 1319nm.</p>



<h4 id="133348-04022016">13:33:48-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>Borrowed a head from the Strontium lab which should do the trick.  First I am going to actually measure the output power of the laser after the isolator and the waveplates when optimized to get a good reading.  It takes some time for it warm up to a stable reading and at low power it is not very stable.  After adjustment, it wanders by a few percent.  I will try to give error bars on this plot. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-f_D0dmm-ihA/VrOkYJr9mgI/AAAAAAAAHMc/j2eVe5lkIrc/s0/innolightpower.png" alt="enter image description here" title="innolightpower.png"></p>

<p>Clearly, the laser is not stable at lower power, but is stable around 350 mW output.  I will now align this into the fiber.  </p>

<p>Set current to 2.227, so the power is about 63 mW before fiber.  </p>



<h4 id="145918-04022016">14:59:18-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>I have a meeting with Arne soon, I want to look over his plots and my plots before we meet so I have some idea what going on.</p>



<h4 id="175040-04022016">17:50:40-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>Meeting went very well we are going to try to compare our TWA simulations and then work on drawing some conclusions together.  I need to figure out how seed initial states within the TWA framework and code that up.</p>

<p>I am going to take another stab at aligning the SFG system.  I need to get the 1319nm laser into the fiber.</p>

<p>I have aligned it and am getting about 20 mW out of the fiber, although its hard to tell because power fluctuates so much.  Looking back at Arne’s notebook, it seems he used</p>

<p>Power 1319 = 225 mW <br>
Power 1064 = 160 mW <br>
Resistance = 6.255 k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-14">\Omega</script>, although this is probably higher now.</p>

<p>So lets first align the TA again as we will need to realign the 1319 system after this.</p>

<p>Then we will align the fiber at 2A input current into the TA.  We will do the following procedure</p>

<ol>
<li>Align TA through fiber at low power</li>
<li>Align TA through fiber at high power</li>
<li>Align 1319 through fiber at low power</li>
<li>Align 1319 through fiber at high power</li>
<li>Put into SFG crystal.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the past we would seed the crystal with the 1319 light before cranking up the TA, so we will also do that here.  Note that this power meter is super slow, so one needs to wait after each adjustment.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, playing with the waveplate before the TA can help get more power through the fiber, this must have to do with the spatial mode coming out of the TA.</p>

<p>Raised TA current to 1A.  I am getting efficiency’s of about 20%.  Arne was getting efficiencies of about 14% at 2A, so we will proceed to 2A.</p>

<p>Arne got 143mW after the fiber, we are at 2000.1 mA of TA current and after the fiber our output is 145 <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-15">\pm</script> 1 mW.</p>

<p>Now we want to get about 225mW of 1319nm light after the fiber.  We will now set that up.  We will align at successively higher powers and hopefully we get the amount we want out with a reasonable input current.</p>

<p>At 2.678A, getting 219mA after the fiber.  These numbers are comparable to what Arne had.  </p>

<p>Now I am turning on the temperature control from the SFG crystal, everything looks fine, lets give this a try.</p>

<p>GOT LIGHT!!!!</p>

<p>At first only 1.4 mW, optimized temperature to 6.077 k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-16">\Omega</script>, I get out 8.5mW.  Big change from the waveplate after the TA.  </p>



<h4 id="192602-04022016">19:26:02-04/02/2016</h4>

<p>163mW of 589 light!!!!!  </p>

<p>Current settings are  <br>
T = 6.077k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-17">\Omega</script> <br>
I(TA) = 2001.4 mA <br>
I(Innolight) = 2.679 A</p>

<p>We will let it sit for a few minutes to get a sense of the stability.</p>

<p>This seems pretty stable, it certainly is not having the issues as the setup in the old lab.</p>

<p>There are a few things which can be optimized without changing the alignment:</p>

<ul>
<li>TA current</li>
<li>Mephisto current</li>
<li>waveplates (all of them after isolators as changing the TA mode can help)</li>
<li>Temperature of crystal</li>

<p>Yesterday we had a meeting with Arne and Ryan about the calculations we have been doing.  There are few things we want to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify TWA approximation works.  Ryan Barnett seeds his intitial state differently than Ryan Wilson and we want to make sure they agree in the vacuum case and use the correct case when possible.  I will write out here the proper way to seed.</li>
<li>Verify TWA accuracy against coherent and Fock state evolution, both Chebyshev and normal.</li>
<li>Verify reversal pulses with microwaves in all approximations for ~ 10k atoms.</li>
<li>Verify RF pulses in all cases with small atom number ( ~100 atoms) as the full quantum RF pulse has a huge basis state (Ryan Wilson will handle coding the full quantum case, we will just do TWA).</li>
<li>Optimize pulse sequence with arbitrary rotations and phase pulses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I will attempt to do a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get Ryan Barnett’s TWA code running on a windows computer (I have it compiled on a linux box I have at home).  The complication is how to include the extra Eigen routines he uses.  I will use visual studio at work and figure this out (although I am considering running linux at work too).</li>
<li>Figure out the proper distribution to sample from when the state is not vacuum seeded.</li>
<li>Verify TWA code across all cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of the screws are pretty bad, I am going to replace them with proper screws (and washers).  In the old setup, the lowered the beam from the output to the rest of the optics with a few mirrors after the output of the SFG.  I believe this was to integrate the system into the old dye laser system.  We will <em>not</em> do this.   We will raise all the optics to the same height and replace the smaller bases with larger ones for better stability.</p>



<h4 id="103146-08022016">10:31:46-08/02/2016</h4>

<p>Turned on SFG system</p>

<p>Current settings are  <br>
T = 6.078k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-21">\Omega</script> <br>
I(TA) = 2002.0 mA <br>
I(Innolight) = 2.678 A</p>

<p>Only getting about 140 mW, but the room temperature has really changed, I am going to try to optimize the waveplates for the 1064 light.  I now have 147 mW.  I will let everything warm up for a while and see what I get.</p>



<h4 id="130318-08022016">13:03:18-08/02/2016</h4>

<p>System output is like 155mW.  </p>

<p>Checked the typical characteristics of a 10<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-22">k\Omega</script>, given by the curve below <br>
<img src="http://www.medteq.info/med/files/Image/NTC10k.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>Thus our current temperature should be fine.</p>

<p>Found new maximum output power for the TEC at 6.046 <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-23">k\Omega</script>.  At long as we are above around <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-24">k\Omega</script>, would should be okay.</p>

<p>We are now going to fire the TI sublimation pumps and outgas them in preparation for the cool down in the next few days.</p>

<p>Quote from the manual</p>

<pre><code>Rough pump the system to a pressure below 10-2 Torr/mbar range and outgas each new filament in turn at a current of 37 to 42 A for at least 1 minute. 
</code></pre>

<p>We will run 38A for 1.5 minutes.  I have increased the data taking pace, so we should get a reading every 15 seconds or so. </p>



<h1 id="2112016">2/11/2016</h1>

<p>For the past few days I have worked on the simulations whose details will be in the report which I will link to.</p>



<h4 id="132949-11022016">13:29:49-11/02/2016</h4>

<p>I am aligning the repump laser optics and I need to figure out the proper settings for each of the three AOM drivers which comprise the setup.</p>



<h1 id="2122016">2/12/2016</h1>



<h4 id="093811-12022016">09:38:11-12/02/2016</h4>

<p>I am going to use a scope to characterize each of the 5 AOM drivers for the laser systems in terms of both their output power and frequency at each of the settings on the driver.  For ones which have more control, its just to make sure they work.</p>

<p>I am going to use a 20 dB attenuator with the proper 50 <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-25">\Omega</script> termination.</p>



<h4 id="145428-12022016">14:54:28-12/02/2016</h4>

<p>Lowered temperatures in system (see Don’s notebook for details).</p>

<p>I measured each of the AOM drivers used in the laser system and the frequencies they are <em>approximately</em> set  at  are as follows (note they could have been changed during the move).</p>

<p>Now I will try to figure out our entire cooling and trapping scheme so it can be implemented correctly.</p>



<h1 id="2152016">2/15/2016</h1>

<p>I looked at the pressure data as we cool down the system.  At the moment, we have not quite reached room temperature, but I have fit the data to an exponential. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GhFhy1rM9y0/VsIOrLGjqQI/AAAAAAAAHQc/dQ9KzlZnb7s/s0/bakeplot.png" alt="bakedata" title="bakeplot.png"></p>

<p>The fit is fairly good, however, the pressure appears to still be going down nicely.  We are about a factor of two better than before we started baking for a month, so hopefully we will get down a bit further as the system cools down another 10 degrees or so.  This should leave us optimistically in the high <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-26">10^{-10}</script> Torr range.  After applying the TI sublimation pumps we may be able to get another factor of 2-4 putting us at the edge of what we might be able to work with.</p>

<p>I think the temperatures we are seeing in the system are a result of the ion gauge heating up the main chamber, thus, we are approximately as cold as we will be running (although this gauge will not be on during experimentation).  We may go down a few degrees when the foil is removed.</p>



<h4 id="133532-15022016">13:35:32-15/02/2016</h4>

<p>On the advice of Eite, I wrapped the code to compute the spinor evolution in a more efficient eigenvalue solver.  The Hamiltonian is symmetric and tridiagonal, so there is a very efficient solver in LAPACK implementing a very fast algorithm for this case.  It is quoted to be about <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-27">O(n^2)</script> as opposed to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-28">O(n^3)</script> of the general symmetric hamiltonian solver implemented in scipy.  Wrapping the routine is slightly non-trivial as it requires using cython to interface to underlying C code and fortran routines, but the ipython notebook makes it somewhat easy.  The cython code neded is</p>

<p>Wrapping the LAPACK routines like this could be very useful for other applications.   Using these routines allows us to do the full quantum calculations for 40000 atoms in a few minutes.</p>

<h1 id="2172016">2/17/2016</h1>

<p>The system has reached equilibrium, so it is time to fire the TI sublimation pumps.  The instructions say to run the current at 46-48 A for a time period not exceeding five minutes.  Our procedure will be to run each filament at 47 A for 1.5 minutes with at least five minute breaks in between.  Hopefully this will get our pressure down a bit.  I will also increase the rate of data taking so we can watch more closely as it occurs.</p>

<p>The following table with give the times of firing for each of the TI pumps</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Pump</th>
  <th>Time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Elbow-1</td>
  <td>8:29</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>After running the first filament, I am a bit worried as I didn’t see any significant pumping, it just seemed to outgas and then go down slowly.  I am going to wait a while to see if the pressure gets down further than where it started (~1.3e-9).  If it looks good, I will commence with using the rest of the filaments.</p>



<h4 id="083812-17022016">08:38:12-17/02/2016</h4>

<p>Now that we have figured out the approximate frequency settings for the six AOM’s used in the cooling and repump systems, we will work through the set up here in an attempt to make sure everything is as it should be.</p>

<p>The cooling is done on the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-31">D_2; \  ^3S_{1/2}|F=2,m_F=2\rangle\to ^3P_{3/2}|F=3,m_F=3\rangle</script> transition.  To understand this system, lets start from the the locking signal which we know must be at the bare atomic resonance.  The frequency of the laser is not changed before it is double passed through the saturation absorption AOM, inducing a frequency shift of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-32">f_1=2mf_{SAT}</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-33">F_{SAT}</script> is the frequency of the saturation absorption spectroscopy AOM.</p>

<p>Denoting the frequency of the cooling laser as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-34">\nu_c</script>, and the frequency of the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-35">D_2</script> line as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-36">f_D</script>, then we have that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-37">\nu_c = f_D-2mf_{SAT},</script></p>

<p>We also know that cooling light is double passed through an AOM which means the cooling frequency is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-38">\nu + 2 m f_{COOL}</script> where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-39">F_{COOL}</script> is the frequency of the cooling AOM, which is set around 41 MHz for a total shift of 82.6 MHz in the old shift.  This detuning is necessary for proper laser cooling.  </p>

<p>The imaging beam is resonant with the atomic transition, thus it must be passed through an AOM at twice the frequency of the saturation absorption experiment such that is also on resonance.</p>

<p>For the repump system we have shifts of 98.6,80, and 200 MHz.  Denoting <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-40">\nu_R</script> as the repump, the repump lock is shifted by 200 MHz, the mot beam by about 96.86 MHz and the Zeeman repump by 200 \pm 80 MHz, I am not sure which direction the last AOM shifts yet.</p>



<h1 id="2182016">2/18/2016</h1>

<p>I aligned the repump system today.  Note that the drawing is a bit odd, however every AOM uses the +1 order, except for the Zeeman beam where the zeeman repump is the -1 order.  </p>

<p>I tried to make some headway on the cable management for the AOM driver cables and I think it looks okay, possibly there is a better solution.  The best solution would be to get some shorter BNC cables, so I will look to replace them later after we have set up everything else and I can see what sorts of sizes we have left.</p>

<p>The pressure is still coming down, tomorrow we will tighten everything which will hopefully help.</p>



<h1 id="2192016">2/19/2016</h1>

<p>Turned on SFG system, settings: <br>
T = 6.077k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-41">\Omega</script> <br>
I(TA) = 2000mA <br>
I(Innolight) = 2.678 A</p>

<p>Aligning Darkspot AOM, undefracted power is 19.6 mW at settings I have.</p>



<h4 id="132429-19022016">13:24:29-19/02/2016</h4>

<p>I have started seeing power fluctuations in the laser by about 30%.  Every minute or so it instantly loses up to half of the power and then within a few seconds recovers to its previous power.  I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing the crystal temperature</li>
<li>Changing the currents in both TA and Mephisto.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to be correlated with power fluctuations in the NP photonics fiber laser.  Going to do a full restart of the computer control and the laser.  Procedure will be </p>

<ol>
<li>Turn down TA current</li>
<li>Turn off laser</li>
<li>Restart computer software</li>
<li>Turn on laser</li>
<li>Turn up TA current.</li>
</ol>

<p>Going to give it about 15 minutes to warm up.  The only difference between the current method of running the laser and the procedure in the old lab was that we are not currently locking the frequency, however this really should matter in terms of power fluctuations.</p>

<p>Problem fixed by enabling RIN suppression.  Stable 154 mW at current settings, going back to alignment.  </p>



<h4 id="143018-19022016">14:30:18-19/02/2016</h4>

<p>I am getting a diffraction efficiency of 74%.  I will now move on to the AOM for the darkspot.  I am getting an efficiency of 50% here.  It is time to try to get the actual powers we need such that I can really figure out what needs to be aligned.</p>

<p>The powers we used to have:</p>

<h4 id="173415-19022016">17:34:15-19/02/2016</h4>

<p>Turned off:</p>

<ul>
<li>TA</li>
<li>Mephisto</li>
<li>TEC control for SFG crystal.</li>
<li>RIN suppression</li>
</ul>

<p>Changed the connection to the Zeeman repump AOM in the hopes that it will help the diffraction efficiency.  It is still a mystery why the output power on the driver is -10.5 dBm as that is quite lower than the rated power for the AOM itself.  Its possible there was an amplifier which is missing.  If the new connection does not work, I will try to turn up the power and see if I can get better efficiency.</p>



<h1 id="2222016">2/22/2016</h1>

<p>Turned on SFG system, settings: <br>
T = 6.077k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-42">\Omega</script> <br>
I(TA) = 2000mA <br>
I(Innolight) = 2.678 A</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot find the amplifier, but the output right now is microwatts to an AOM which is rated for hundreds of milliwatts.  As expected, when changing the output power on the signal generator, the power diffracted into the first order went up, so the AOM is working fine and everything is how it should be.  The likely cause is that the signal generator cannot output enough power and a fixed amplifier was used requiring an output power of -10dBm from the generator.  I will attempt to find the manual to see if this is the case.  It appears as if the maximum output power is around 13 dBm which is 19.95 mW, thus the amplifier theory is probably correct.  I will spend some time later trying to find said amplifier.</p>



<h4 id="133059-22022016">13:30:59-22/02/2016</h4>

<p>Added a 33dBm amplifier, so we should be able to up to -4dBm on the generator and stay safely below 900mW of output power.  This rating is for the 200 MHz AOM, not the 250 MHz AOM, so it is likely we actually have even more leeway.  </p>



<h4 id="152258-22022016">15:22:58-22/02/2016</h4>

<p>I am now setting up the spectroscopy.  I am going to modify our initial plan and keep the wavemeter on another part of the table fibercoupled to the spectroscopy setup.  I will then use the space to put an extra Fabry-Perot (IR) which we will buy soon. </p>

<p>Turned off NP-Photonics laser for the night as it was still having some power fluctuations and I want to see if turning it off for a while would help.</p>



<h1 id="2232016">2/23/2016</h1>

<p>Didn’t realize that the beatnote photodiode is so large when designing the spectroscopy setup and thus the rearrangement of the SFG system setup to accommodate a potential future spatial filter has thrown off the design.  Thus I will have to replan the setup. </p>



<h4 id="105845-23022016">10:58:45-23/02/2016</h4>

<p>After shutting down the NPphotonics laser for the night, it is running at a more normal power (65mW as compared to 70mW), so this higher power could be caused by running it in current mode which is not how we generally run it.</p>



<h4 id="114656-23022016">11:46:56-23/02/2016</h4>

<p>Spectroscopy setup is placed on the table, after lunch will turn on lasers and try to align it.  Plan for alignment is </p>

<ol>
<li>Alignment saturation absorption experiment</li>
<li>Lock cooling laser with lock-in amplifier set up.</li>
<li>Align lasers to beatnote diode</li>
<li>Attempt to lock all lasers</li>
</ol>



<h4 id="141150-23022016">14:11:50-23/02/2016</h4>

<p>Turning on SHG system, running with 3100 mA current. </p>



<h4 id="182232-23022016">18:22:32-23/02/2016</h4>

<p>Have the system aligned without the double pass to dither the frequency, so I will instead dither it with the laser itself and then trigger off this to make sure I can see the general absorption feature.  </p>



<h1 id="2242016">2/24/2016</h1>

<p>We are rebaking and the temperature seems a bit too hot in the chambers (160), so I am lowering the relevant variac by 5.</p>

<p>I want to heat up the sodium cell, I am using a variac and some heat tape to keep it hot.  I would like it to get up to something like 50 C.  I will make a table of Variac setting and temperature at steady state.  I am measuring at the very end of the cell so I would say this is a lower limit. </p>

<p>The spectroscopy will setup before the other systems are fully aligned.  I am going to put in permanent pinholes (two for each setup) such that we can easily realign the beam into the spectroscopy without realigning the spectroscopy itself.  </p>

<p>I have fiber coupled the system to the Burleigh wavemeter which I will try to get working so I can get the laser at roughly the right frequency (enough to see features).  I have coupled the light into the wavemeter, but it doesn’t seem to work. I keep getting a range error.  This could mean that the wavemeter became misaligned during the move.</p>



<h1 id="2262016">2/26/2016</h1>

<p>Coded up the abilitity to do arbitrary state preparation in the full quantum simulation.  Plan is to solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of all potential states for 10k atoms, c=30,q=-5, then I can prepare the state and evolve however I feel like (the evolution scales pretty well as its just matrix multiplication).</p>



<h4 id="131308-26022016">13:13:08-26/02/2016</h4>

<p>Removing NIST data and doing fresh install of windows on analysis computer, then I will be able to run the lasers off this computer temporarily and the pressure monitoring will have no lapses.  Bake is having some odd behavior as the pressure does not seem to stop rising even though the temperature is constant.</p>

<p>When re-installing windows I had to change the BIOS to not use the RAID configuration on the hard drive.  This is something I remember needing to do on other computers and I think it has something to do with the way NIST sets up the computers.  It can be changed back after install.</p>



<h4 id="150515-26022016">15:05:15-26/02/2016</h4>

<p>Windows in installed and laser is working from control by this computer.  I have moved the fiber to be in an easier spot to measure both the repump and and cooling lasers.  I am going to put in the flip mirrors and try to get the fiber re-aligned.  I have put in a lens on a translation stage to help match the fiber mode.</p>

<p>Got the wavemeter working.  It reads 16973.34 cm<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-43">^{-1}</script> which corresponds to 589.16 nm.  The <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-44">D_2</script> line is at 589.1583264 nm, so  this is within .01 cm<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-45">^{-1}</script> or about a third of a GHz.  So this should be good enough to do the absorbtion spectroscopy if the cell is hot enough.</p>

<p>I have a signal, but it is just a mode hop, I am going to try heating the cell hotter in order to increase the density.  </p>



<h4 id="165853-26022016">16:58:53-26/02/2016</h4>

<p>Cell is still too cold at 60, I am going to heat it to around 100, looking at the density plots in Steck’s notes, this seems to be a decent temperature for this experiment at least in comparison with Rubidium where one does not have to heat the cell.  Turned the variac up to 5.5.</p>

<p>I am going to scan the current now between 270 and 290 mA and the temperature between 20 and 22 C to try to see a fluorescence flash.</p>



<h4 id="182347-26022016">18:23:47-26/02/2016</h4>

<p>Didn’t get it today, will try again tomorrow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Laser Off</li>
<li>DL PRO off</li>
<li>Turned variac down to 3.5 since I don’t want it to get too hot and I’m not sure how hot it will get at 5.5.  I will check on it again before I leave.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ion current at 3.1e-4.  Pressure is looking a bit better.</p>



<h1 id="2272016">2/27/2016</h1>



<h4 id="115103-27022016">11:51:03-27/02/2016</h4>

<p>Ion current is at 3.2e-4 (oscillating between 3.3 at times).  Turned variac back to 5.5, I will monitor to check what the steady state temperature turns out to be.</p>

<p>Turning on the cooling laser to let it warm up as well.</p>



<h4 id="123053-27022016">12:30:53-27/02/2016</h4>

<p>Ion current is at 3.7e-4, but seems to be coming down.  There was a temperature fluctuation in the room and, so this could have had an effect.  The cell temperature is now at 101, I am going to raise the variac to 6.5, hopefully this will give me enough density to see something. </p>

<p>At 20C, Rubidium has a vapor pressure of 1e-7 Torr.  Sodium reaches that vapor pressure at about 105 C, since we are now above that point (112 C) (see correction below), we should be able to see something as Rb does not need to be heated to do absorption spectroscopy.  </p>

<p>One other issue is that I am using the burleigh wavemeter to roughly calibrate the wavelength and it may have some sort of offset, I am going to try to figure that out first.</p>

<p>To get the right reading on the Wavemeter, had to lower the temperature to 19.8C.  The issue is that this is a very imprecise reading.  </p>



<h4 id="135221-27022016">13:52:21-27/02/2016</h4>

<p>Raised the cell temperature again, variac setting is at 7.  Temperature is now 119 C. (See correction below)</p>

<p>After looking through a bunch of old lab notebooks, I believe the measure wavelength of the wavemeter was 16973.35 which I get with settings of Temperature dial 4.92 and current dial 8.50.  This gives a temperature of 19.9 C and a current of 279 mA.  Still seeing no fluorescence from the sodium cell</p>



<h4 id="151550-27022016">15:15:50-27/02/2016</h4>

<p>Have done a literature search and found temperatures around 150 C are pretty common.  I will try to heat a bit more.  Changed position of thermocouple and found that it was touching heat tape, so all the temperatures quoted were not accurate, they were far too low.  So real temperatures were more like 80 C.  Thus we will have to heat more.</p>

<p>FINALLY saw the fluorescence.  Variac at 8.5, temperature on the <em>cell</em> right above 100.  It is not really a flash as I expected, but if you look with a cell phone camera, its obvious.  </p>

<p>I have aligned the saturation absorption beams, but I think I need to play with the powers.  I am going to go home now and come back tomorrow.  I will turn down the variac a bit just to be safe to 4.</p>

<p>Heating up cell, will just leave it after heated up today and I make sure its stable.  Pressure looks like it is rising in the chamber, but maybe not at the ion pump?  This is surprising.  Ion current 4e-4.  Still see the the fluorescence, now need to get the double passed AOM and the lock-in working.</p>



<h4 id="134521-29022016">13:45:21-29/02/2016</h4>

<p>Degassed and fired TI-sub pumps.  Saw a reduction in pressure, but then it climbed back up.  </p>



<h4 id="141759-29022016">14:17:59-29/02/2016</h4>

<p>Turned down Zeeman slower variac from 40 to 20.</p>



<h4 id="150129-29022016">15:01:29-29/02/2016</h4>

<p>Turned down V3 (chamber) from 70 to 60.  (Accidentally read it upside down and went to 90 for a few minutes, have corrected it, it corresponded to a one degree spike).</p>

<p>Looked at Beam with fabry perot.  Now scanning with sin wave.  376 MHz scan per 30 mV of amplitude on an SRS function generator.  </p>

<p>We have a saturated absorption signal, tomorrow I will optimize it and then lock the laser with the lock-in.  Now I need to work on my summary of the simulations for tomorrows meeting.</p>

<p>Turning down V4 (4 way east) from 80 - 40.</p>

<p>Now I am going to optimize the feed forward mechanism in the DLPro and try to align the spectroscopy better (now that we actually have the signal).  Looking at the Fabry Perot signal, it looks like it is pretty well tuned already.  It would be badly tuned if over a reasonable range, we saw mode hops, but since we are seeing no mode hops over a very large scan range, I am not going to mess with it as I can’t optimize it any better.</p>



<h4 id="143002-01032016">14:30:02-01/03/2016</h4>

<p>Power outage at around 2 pm, had to turn off ion pump since the current spiked, lost vacuum completely.   The issue was that the gate valve did not close when the power went out and the backing pump for the turbo shut off.  Ideally, I would have just closed the gate valve, but I could not see and the ion pump was already dangerously high, it could not have pumped down the system.</p>

<p>Setting up double pass AOM for the lock in amplification of the saturated absorption spectroscopy.  </p>

<p>Here is the circuit for the laser lock box. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VAgw1JAd7JE23DrDdZQa4IAM1ux5MFvJwnfcfZEg7C0Vxpuhimdn7ZOH_6ELS3WmjhF8=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="20160302_124404.jpg"></p>

<p>So the lock-in amplifier output goes to E, the DC offset to DC, and the output to the laser analog channel.  The integrator output goes to the scope.</p>

<p>Gave talk today about simulating Spinor Dynamics.</p>



<h4 id="131340-03032016">13:13:40-03/03/2016</h4>

<p>I am noticing interference peaks on the photodiode.  I am wondering what these are.  I am going to send the other laser into the spectroscopy system to see if it might have something to do with the optics.</p>

<p>Turned on SFG system, settings: <br>
T = 6.077k<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-46">\Omega</script> <br>
I(TA) = 2000mA <br>
I(Innolight) = 2.678 A</p>

<p>I have determined the diffraction is not due to the glass cell by removing it.  It could be due to the laser having terrible output (I know its single mode).</p>



<h4 id="151921-03032016">15:19:21-03/03/2016</h4>

<p>Need to re-align double pass AOM, it looks terrible.  Finished doing this, beam profile is much better.  I have a nice signal, but it is still on top of this sinusoidal motion, not sure how to get rid of that.</p>



<h4 id="172505-03032016">17:25:05-03/03/2016</h4>

<p>I cannot get a signal out of the lock-in amplifier.  I think the problem is that the modulation is only 400 mVpp since the box is 50<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-47">\Omega</script> terminated.   There was an attatchment on the box that is not there now which may have helped with this.</p>

<p>Lock-in amplifier works, its unclear if the lock box is working.  I will need to investigate this further.</p>



<h1 id="372016">3/7/2016</h1>

<p>Friday and this morning I computed the phase sensitivity of our interferometer out of the low pump depletion limit.  I am doing a much finer calculation now which should be done in a few hours.  </p>



<h4 id="134034-07032016">13:40:34-07/03/2016</h4>

<p>Looking at the lockbox, found a broken wire from the out pin to the E pin.  This is why the error signal was not being read throug hthe box, but the rest of the circuit worked perfectly well (I think).  I will solder it back on and then it should be fixed.   Looks like laser is locking although it doesn’t seem like I see the same thing on the screen as at NIST.  I need to figure that out.</p>

<p>It seems like we were actually looking at the output of the signal and not the integrated signal before.  I am missing one last box which must be some sort of voltage divider because the output signal is very large compared to the necessary voltage to tweak the signal going to analog on the laser box.</p>



<h1 id="382016">3/8/2016</h1>

<p>Some thoughts about the Lock Box.  It is a PI circuit (proportional-integrator).  We are monitoring the input signal from the Lock-In amplifier as the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-48">y</script> axis and signal from the DC input knob as the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-49">x</script> axis.  </p>



<h4 id="120315-08032016">12:03:15-08/03/2016</h4>

<p>Cooling laser locked.  </p>

<p>Idea:  Use a Raspberry PI to provide DC voltage and also to control locking switch, so it could possibly re-lock while still using analog circuitry for actual Locking (speed might be necessary).</p>



<h4 id="173113-08032016">17:31:13-08/03/2016</h4>

<p>Looking at the possibility of using a new beatnote lock box which has been developed by Gretchen’s group.  Should be much better than what we have now and relatively easy to put together.</p>

<h4 id="113124-09032016">11:31:24-09/03/2016</h4>

<p>Re-locked to show Don, but lock was still good.  I will set up an arduino to monitor the error signal at some point.</p>



<h4 id="135050-09032016">13:50:50-09/03/2016</h4>

<p>Still locked</p>



<h4 id="150445-09032016">15:04:45-09/03/2016</h4>

<p>Still locked, I unlocked it to look at it on a scope so I can get some idea of the error signal while both lock and unlocked.</p>



<h4 id="165414-09032016">16:54:14-09/03/2016</h4>

<p>Turning laser off, no issues with locks.</p>

<p>I have continued working on the interfermeter simulation and have learned some important things</p>

<ol>
<li>Pezze and Smerzi’s state is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-50">\sum_M p_M |0,M,0\rangle\langle 0,M,0|</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-51">p_M</script> is the Poissonian distribution.  Thus they are running their simulations for a Poissonian mixed state of Fock states which is not necessarily the best initial state to choose.  However, for a vacuum state, I believe this is the same thing is a coherent state in practice.</li>
<li>Maybe used a thermal state which minimizes free energy</li>
</ol>

<p>I am now running the code on the cluster using the array job facility.  This allows me to easily run embarrassingly parallel tasks.  An example code is </p>

<p>The goal of this is to see how low we can get with just the turbo and ion pump for a weekend to make sure there are no more issues with the system.</p>

<h4 id="132042-12032016">13:20:42-12/03/2016</h4>

<p>Turned on ion pump, after a minute only got down to 4e-3 A and the pressure was 1.5e-6, so I turned it off and I will wait another hour or so.   Pressure is 6e-6 without ion pump.  Pressure in oven chamber is 7.5e-8.</p>



<h4 id="135454-12032016">13:54:54-12/03/2016</h4>

<p>Pressure at 2.8e-6 without ion pump on, so turned it on.  After a minute or so current at 3.2e-3 which is a bit high, but still going down.</p>



<h4 id="140223-12032016">14:02:23-12/03/2016</h4>

<p>After less than ten minutes, pressure is about 9e-7, and ion current is 2.5e-3, which is a bit higher than I would like, but still going down.  </p>



<h4 id="141831-12032016">14:18:31-12/03/2016</h4>

<p>Ion current at 1.5e-3, pressure is at 6.5e-7, so things are looking pretty good.</p>



<h4 id="145050-12032016">14:50:50-12/03/2016</h4>

<p>Ion current is at 9e-4, so things are progressing nicely.  Pressure is 4.5e-7.  Ion pump should be safe and no longer necessary to monitor.  This current corresponds to about 1.5e-7 Torr at the ion pump, which is completely safe.</p>



<h1 id="3132016">3/13/2016</h1>



<h4 id="094509-14032016">09:45:09-14/03/2016</h4>

<p>I had been propagating variances through the calculation for the Poissonian state incorrectly.  When propagating error, one must either propagate in quadrature or sum over the mean and mean squared and then compute a variance at the end.</p>

<p>The pressure in the system is still coming down, although pretty slowly.  We are not at 1.3e-7 which is lower than we were before we fixed the broken window.  When we replace the blank with another window it would be nice to have a pumping station to accelerate this process. </p>

<p>I also want to design a box for the new beatnote lock.  The inputs and output from this box are </p>

<ul>
<li>Beat signal In</li>
<li>Reference signal In</li>

<li>Piezo Gain Adjustment</li>
<li>Current Out</li>

<li>Arduino</li>
<li>Power</li>

<p>Note that some of the adjustment is coming from a programmable arduino.  A picture of the board is below.</p>

<p>So we will preferable have a box with with inputs on at least two sides.  It would be nice to have the inputs and outputs very close to their actual value.  Looking at the digikey website.</p>

<p>Closed valve to the leak detector, pressure immediately dropped.  The temperature also dropped.  The temperature sensor was near the leak detector and I think that it was reading a higher temperature as a result.</p>

We can look at the interfermotric fringers as a function of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-56">q</script>, which relate to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-57">\phi</script> by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-58">\phi = 2\pi (2 q t_{ev})</script>:</p>

<p>and also the sensitivity after performing the reversal</p>

<p>We have computed these for both the Poisson mixed state (which should be equivalent to the coherent state for a vacuum seeded non-magnetized initial state) and the Fock state for low atom numbers.  Noting that the agreement was quite good, especially for longer times we are interested in, we computed the Fock state sensitivity for higher atom number as it is much easier to compute the evolution.  The straight lines are the standard quantum limit for that evolution.  It is not dependent on the phase pulse, only on the evolution time.</p>

<p>Each of these samples 100 <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-59">q</script> for 25 different <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-60">t_{ev}</script> and for each <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-61">q</script>, there are three full reversal calculations to allow taking a numerical derivative.  Thus, there are around 7,500 calculations taking place.  Each calculation requires three separate diagonalizations, however, I could really speed up the process by saving the first diagonalization as it will be the same as the third.  This can be easily done by Memoization.  The best way to get speed will actually be to get cython on the cluster.  The optimized diagonalization function is a 15x or so speedup at 10k atoms and it takes less time to do two of these than one of the non-optimized function.  I have put in a request.</p>

<p>Can run high atom numbers with the Fock calculation up to 20,000 atoms in a reasonable time without the cluster.  This relies on the fact that we don’t need to recompute parts of the evolution for each evolution.  In fact we only need to diagonalize a matrix for each different value of q.  So procedure goes as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Diagonalize matrix for non-phase pulse times</li>
<li>Loop through q values and diagonalize phase matrix</li>
<li>Loop through t_ev and evolve time (no diagonalization here!)</li>
<li>Compute various things we want <br>
Now we only have to diagonalize <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-63">3q+1</script> matrices (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-64">3q</script> to get good idea of numerical derivative.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I have also implemented the TWA code in the same fashion and it works quite well for mean values, etc.  the issue is in computing the numerical derivative.  Since each realization is a different value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-65">q</script>, computing the derivative is unstable without many,many averages since there is a slight error in the ensemble choice.  One way to get around this would be to use the same ensemble to do each <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-66">q</script> evolution needed for the numerical derivative.  I will see if there are other options.</p>



<h1 id="3162016">3/16/2016</h1>

<p>I am thinking about the interferometric sequence and what we might possibly put in a theory paper that has not already been done.  I have finally figured out the phase issue.  Most of the following material comes form the Smerzi paper.</p>

<p>The phase shift Hamiltonian is given as  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-67"> H = q N_+,</script> <br>
where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-68">N_{+} = N_{+1} + N_{-1}</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-69">q</script> is our case the quadratic zeeman shift although in principle it could be any energy difference between the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-70">m_F=0</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-71">m_F=\pm 1</script> pir sites.  Applying the unitary transformation <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-72">e^{-iHt/\hbar}</script>, gives rise to a phase shift of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-73">\theta = 2 q t</script>.  Now we can perform our interferometric sequence  <br>
1. Evolve with spinor dynamics <br>
2. Phase encoding and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-74">\pi/2</script> phase shift to the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-75">m_F=0</script> mode  <br>
3. second evolution with spinor dymanics <br>
The <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-76">\pi/2</script> phase pulse is the phase reversal pulse and the phase encoding is any deviation from <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-77">\pi/2</script>.  In our experiment we will apply the phase encoding with the same pulse as the reversal.  The simulations show that our optimal sensitvity comes with a phase pulse of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-78">\pi/2</script> which matches the Smerzi paper with optimal Fisher information at <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-79">\theta=0</script>.   </p>



<h1 id="3182016">3/18/2016</h1>

<p>I need to give a poster next week, need to think about that.</p>



<h4 id="094354-18032016">09:43:54-18/03/2016</h4>

<p>Looked up the electronics for the PLL board, we need a MHz reference source in the range of tens of MHz.  This should be doable with an SRS frequency generator, but we could also get a MHz crystal.</p>

<p>Now, lets figure out mean field Pezze approac.  replacing <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-80">a_0</script> with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-81">\sqrt{n}</script> , where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-82">n</script> is the average particle number, we can introcue operators <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.33.4033">Yurke,McCall,Klauder</a> <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-83">\begin{align}
K_x &= \frac{1}{2}(a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger +a_{+1}a_{-1})\notag\\
K_y &= \frac{1}{2i}(a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger- a_{+1}a_{-1})\notag\\
K_z &= \frac{1}{2}(a_{+1}^\dagger a_{+1}+a_{-1}^\dagger a_{-1}+1),
\end{align}</script> <br>
which belong to the SU(1,1) group (thus SU(1,1) interferometer) and thus satisfy commutation relations of the SU(1,1) Lie algebra (See J. Opt. Soc. Am. B/Vol. 2, No. 3/March 1985 for thorough review).  So we can write the Hamiltonian for the Spin mixing dynamics up to a constant term as  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-84">\begin{equation}
H = (2n-1) \chi\hbar K_z + 2n\chi\hbar(K_x \cos2\phi + K_y\sin2\phi)
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and the Hamiltonian for the phase pulse as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-85">H=2q\hbar K_z</script>.  So if we start in vacuum, then after some time <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-86">t</script>, the spinor dynamics give rise to a population in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-87">N_+ = N_{+1}+N_{-1}</script> mode of  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-88">\begin{equation}
N(t) = \frac{8n^2}{4n-1}\sinh^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{4n-1}}{2}\chi t\right)
\end{equation}</script></p>

<p>Now lets see how we get this.  We start from the Hamiltonian for the single mode picture <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-89">\begin{equation}
H = \chi\hbar (e^{2i\phi}a_0^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_{+1}a_{-1} + e^{-2i\phi}a_0 a_0 a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger) + \chi\hbar (N_0 - 1/2)(N_{+1}+N_{-1}),
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and if now replace <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-90">a_0 \to \sqrt{n}</script>, and for large <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-91">n</script> approximate <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-92">a_0^\dagger = \sqrt{n}</script>.  Note that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-93">\chi=c/(2N)</script>, in our normal language.  Thus, we can write  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-94">\begin{align}
H &= \chi\hbar (e^{2i\phi}a_0^\dagger a_0^\dagger a_{+1}a_{-1} + e^{-2i\phi}a_0 a_0 a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger) + \chi\hbar (N_0 - 1/2)(N_{+1}+N_{-1})\notag\\
&=\chi\hbar (e^{2i\phi}na_{+1}a_{-1} + e^{-2i\phi}n a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger) + \chi\hbar (n-1/2)(N_{+1}+N_{-1})\notag\\
&=\chi\hbar n((\cos2\phi + i\sin2\phi)a_{+1}a_{-1} + (\cos2\phi - i\sin2\phi) a_{+1}^\dagger a_{-1}^\dagger) + \chi\hbar (n-1/2)(a_{+1}^\dagger a_{+1}+a_{-1}^\dagger a_{-1})\notag\\
&=2\chi\hbar n( \cos2\phi K_x + \sin2\phi K_y)  +\chi\hbar (n-1/2)(2K_z + 1/2)\notag\\
&=2\chi\hbar n( \cos2\phi K_x + \sin2\phi K_y)  +\chi\hbar (2n-1)K_z,
\end{align}</script> <br>
where we dropped some terms which are a constant offset and therefore do no affect the dynamics.  .  Also note that our phase shift Hamiltonian can be written in terms of these operators as  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-95">\begin{equation}
H_{ps} = \hbar q(N_{+1} + N_{-1}) = 2\hbar q K_z,
\end{equation}</script> <br>
again up to a constant.  </p>

<p>Now we will follow Pezze and Smerzi, where they start with Vacuum in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-96">m_F=\pm 1</script> modes and then operator with the spinor dynamics Hamiltonian at <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-97">\phi=0</script> on the vacuum state <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-98">\begin{equation}
|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-i2\chi n( \cos2\phi K_x + \sin2\phi K_y) t -i\chi(2n-1)K_z t}|0\rangle = e^{-i2\chi n K_x t-i\chi(2n-1)K_z t}|0\rangle,
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and now if we write <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-99">K_x = K_++K_-</script> where the ladder operators are defined in the usual sense, we can use the disentanglement theorem for the SU(1,1) algebra which says that  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-100">\begin{equation}
e^{\gamma_+ K_+ + \gamma_- K_- + \gamma_3 K_z} = \exp(\Gamma_+ K_+)\exp(\ln \Gamma_3 K_z)\exp(\Gamma_- K_-),
\end{equation}</script> <br>
where  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-101">\begin{align}
\Gamma_3&=\left(\cosh\beta - \frac{\gamma_3}{2\beta}\sinh\beta\right)^{-2}\notag\\
\Gamma_\pm&=-\frac{2\gamma_\pm \sinh\beta}{2\beta\cosh\beta-\gamma_3\sinh\beta}\notag\\
\beta^2&=\frac{1}{4}\gamma_3^2-\gamma_+\gamma_-
\end{align}</script> <br>
which gives us the evolution operator if we identify <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-102">\gamma_+=\gamma_- = -i2\chi n t</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-103">\gamma_3 = -i\chi(2n-1)t</script>.  We can now proceed by noting that  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-104">\begin{align}
e^{\gamma_-K_-} |0\rangle&=|0\rangle\notag\\
e^{\ln \Gamma_3 K_z}|0\rangle &= \frac{\ln\Gamma_3}{2}|0\rangle\notag\\
e^{\gamma_+K_+}|0\rangle&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (\Gamma_+)^n |n,n\rangle
\end{align}</script> <br>
thus if we act on our initial vacuum state, we get the time evolution  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-105">\begin{equation}
|\psi(t)\rangle =  \frac{\ln\Gamma_3}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty (\Gamma_+)^n |n,n\rangle,
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and so we are forced to only have pair states and the probability of finding a specific pair state is given by  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-106">\begin{equation}
|\langle n,n|\psi(t)\rangle|^2 = \frac{(\ln \Gamma_3)^2}{4}(\Gamma_+)^{2n}
\end{equation}</script> <br>
which allows to calculate the expectation value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-107">N_+ = n_1+n_2 = 2n</script> (note we will now call the mean atom number <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-108">\bar n</script> to avoid confusion, as  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-109">\begin{equation}
\langle N_+\rangle = \sum_{n}  2n  \frac{(\ln \Gamma_3)^2}{4}(\Gamma_+)^{2n}
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and we can now evaluate the summuation to get that  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-110">\begin{equation}
\langle N_+\rangle =\frac{(\ln \Gamma_3)^2}{2}\frac{\Gamma_+^2}{(\Gamma_+^2-1)^2},
\end{equation}</script> <br>
which is a closed for answer to our problem, note that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-111">|\Gamma_+|<1</script> for this series to converge.  Adding the parameters to the problem, we can calculate <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-112">\begin{equation}
\beta^2 = \frac{-1}{4}\chi^2 (2\bar n-1)^2 t^2 + 4\chi^2 \bar n^2 t^2,
\end{equation}</script> <br>
which allows us to write <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-113">\begin{align}
\beta &= \sqrt{ \frac{-1}{4}\chi^2 (2\bar n-1)^2 t^2 + 4\chi^2 \bar n^2 t^2}\notag\\
&= \chi t\sqrt{ \frac{-1}{4}(2\bar n-1)^2 + 4 \bar n^2}\notag\\
&= \chi t \zeta,
\end{align}</script> <br>
where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-114">\zeta</script> is for notational convenience.  This allows us to write  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-115">\begin{equation}
\ln\Gamma_3 = -2\ln\left(\cosh(\chi t \zeta)+ \frac{i\chi(2\bar n-1)t}{2\chi t \zeta} \sinh(\chi t \zeta)\right),
\end{equation}</script> <br>
and  <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-116">\begin{equation}
\Gamma_+ =  \frac{4i\chi \bar n t\sinh(\chi t \zeta)}{2 \chi t \zeta \cosh(\chi t \zeta) +i\chi(2\bar n-1)t \sinh(\chi t \zeta)},
\end{equation}</script> <br>
which will give us a complicated,but exact expression.  We can also Taylor expand for simpler expressions.  Note that squared expressions are really magnitude squared.</p>

<p>Turbo pump failure in oven chamber, not sure when, I am turning down variacs.  The error says temperature is too high.  This doesn’t really make sense as the temperature was well below what we have run it before.</p>

<p>I tried using a different thermocouple reader from the manual one I was using before and the temperature was at least ten degrees higher than reported.  This was probably the issue.  I will wait until the temperature goes down before attempting to restart the turbo.</p>



<h4 id="121028-26032016">12:10:28-26/03/2016</h4>

<p>I think that the oven top heater is still to high, turning it down.  Last time we baked, we kept it quite low.  I think that this was the problem.  The thermocouple seems to be faulty which was measuring the temperature.</p>

<p>My conclusions are that monitoring the temperature on the outside of the turbopump is not good enough, we should have an internal monitor of the pump as well which is potentially possible.  I am not too worried about any damage since the pump turns itself off quite quickly.   I will wait an hour or two before attempting to turn it back on to ensure that the temperature is reasonable.</p>

<p>Tried turning on turbo pump, no failures and it spun up, but overload light came on, so I shut it off.  I am going to wait an hour and try again with a lower temperature.</p>

<p>Turned down V6 </p>

<p>I am trying to compare the current to pressure to the system when the window broke.  Our current pressure is 6.2e-8 with the main chamber at a temperature of 150 and the zeeman slower quite cold.</p>

<p>The last time we were at this point was when we tried to bake again after achieving pressure of 5e-10.  We compare to Feb 24, when the chamber was around 165 and the zeeman was quite a bit hotter, we were at 2.457e-8.  We just turned on the Ion pump, so we will get a nice reduction, but with our current temperatures, this gives us a good target.  We should also heat up the zeeman slower quite a bit.  Another note is that the pressures reached prior also included many TI-sublimation pump firings. </p>



<h4 id="103331-30032016">10:33:31-30/03/2016</h4>

<p>Turned Zeeman slower variac up to 30.</p>



<h4 id="111308-30032016">11:13:08-30/03/2016</h4>

<h4 id="112504-30032016">11:25:04-30/03/2016</h4>

<p>Pressure spiked, turned down Zeeman slower to 20.  </p>



<h4 id="113024-30032016">11:30:24-30/03/2016</h4>

<p>Pressure went right down, back up to 30.  Probably there is a ton of stuff in the Zeeman slower.</p>



<h4 id="123838-30032016">12:38:38-30/03/2016</h4>

<p>Turned up zeeman slower variac to 32.5.</p>



<h4 id="130216-30032016">13:02:16-30/03/2016</h4>

<p>Now up to 35 on the zeeman slower variac.</p>

<p>I think either the oven variac or power strip is broken.  I have replaced the power strip and still no heat.  I will replace the variac now.</p>

<p>Slowly leaking the air for the RGA into the system.  Goal is to leak it in and then pump down enough to turn on the ion pump soon.</p>

<p>Leaking is not working, too much in there and the spikes are hard to control.  I am going to shut off the turbo and then restart it after opening the angle valve.</p>

<p>When I opened the angle valve pressure in the system was in the tens of Torr, so I think this was the right move as we were still at least seven orders of magnitude away.  Hopefully this will reduce the time necessary to get back to high vacuum.</p>

<p>Turbo pump successfully restarted, off completely for only a few seconds.  I think the ion pump will probably not be on until tomorrow as it will take a while to pump down.</p>



<h4 id="220644-31032016">22:06:44-31/03/2016</h4>

<p>Pressure at oven is 2e-6.  I am not going to check the pressure in the chamber for an hour or so as is probably at least an order of magnitude lower.</p>

<p>Pressure at oven 1e-7, when I turned on main chamber ion gauge, went up to 1.3e-7.  Chamber pressure reads 3.8e-5.  I am going to leave the ion pump off and turn the gauge off.</p>

<p>At this point the ion pump can almost be turned back on.  One option would be to reduce the temperature in the system and then turn the pump on and then raise the temperature back up.</p>

<p>Turned down heat to oven as I really don’t want the turbo to shut off tonight.</p>

<p>I am trying to go over experimental data we have taken and seeing if I can fit the theory to what we have.</p>



<h3 id="9-11-2013">9-11-2013</h3>

<p>Reversals are  <br>
1. 688 - 1ms rev pulse after 15ms <br>
2. 773 - ” after 20ms <br>
3. 871 - ” after 24ms <br>
4. 378, no shift</p>

<p>Here we are looking at the BEC reversal experiments.  The reversals fit perfectly for different value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-121">q</script> (for the reversal).</p>

<ul>
<li>The reversal at 15ms fits well for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-122">q=-425</script>Hz</li>
<li>Reversal at 20ms fits well for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-123">q=-415</script>Hz</li>
<li>Reversal at 24ms fits well for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-124">q=-385</script>Hz</li>
</ul>

<p>I could make these even better with fitting, this is what the plot looks like with those. <br>

<p>We can see here that the theory matches the data extremely well. </p>

<p>Looking at other data, I have noticed that the optimal <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-125">c</script> varies throughout the day.  This is most likely due to variations in atom number, but I want to see if this is reasonable given our variations.  The variations I see are around 6 Hz.  So the question I am seeking to answer is what change in atom number would give rise to an 6 Hz change in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-126">c</script>?</p>

<p>At some point later in time, I can examine this in detail, however, the paper Number Fluctations by this group seems to indicate this is a pretty good explanation.</p>



<h4 id="140523-08042016">14:05:23-08/04/2016</h4>

<p>Something I would like to try to do now is to see if I can explain the thermal data in terms of losses.  It is given in the paper on fluctuations from this group that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-133">c(t) \propto e^{-2\gamma t/5}</script> where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-134">\gamma \leq 0.02 s^{-1}</script> as measured experimentally (this was measured at a much different time so this number should be taken with a grain of salt.)  So now let us look at how this <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-135">c</script> evolution will affect the simulation results.  I checked, this should have minimal affect on the result (not discernible beyond noise at least).  Regardless, this would no cause losses, but it is good to check anyway.  </p>

<p>They also give an explanation in terms of a modification to the mean field equations of the form <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-136">\beta \dot\rho_0</script>.  We can try to add this in with their measured coefficient of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-137">0.22</script>.  If we add a value which is larger but still same order of magnitude, we get some really nice agreement!</p>

<p>I need to go back to the thermal oscillation data already taken and see if I can extract out a value for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-138">\beta</script> which makes this one reasonable.</p>
