<h1 id="1102016">1/10/2016</h1>

<p>This is the first entry in the markdown lab notebook, we are going to see if we like it.  First thing to do is check the temperatures and the pressures.  Of course this can also be seen on <a href="http://lettspinorlab.github.io/">LettSpinorLab</a> live.  Everything looks good in terms of the circulator outside.</p>

<p>I did not change any of the variacs.  For the rest of the day, I will figure out how to get this lab notebook operational and also work on my simulations.  When I make more measurements, I will add them to the above table.</p>



<h1 id="1112016">1/11/2016</h1>

<p>Today I again checked the temperature and pressure, the temperatures were the same as before, but the Pressure was 1.7E-8 and the ion pump current was 2.6E-5 at 9:31am.  </p>



<h4 id="105004-11012016">10:50:04-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now we will be aligning the sfg system. </p>



<h4 id="131359-11012016">13:13:59-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>We have plugged all the laser power cords into the blue plugs.  Now I will align the TA.  Some notes for setting up the NPPhotonics fiber laser </p>

<ul>
<li>Must select FLM-0107</li>
<li>Must select Rev B</li>
</ul>

<p>After turning on the laser,, we didn’t see any power, so changed fibers to one with green tips on it, PM90-XP.  We were previously using blue tipped fiber.  Output at first is 49.31mW. </p>



<h4 id="163545-11012016">16:35:45-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Aligning the SFG system.  First thing to do is align the Tapered Amplifier.  The light comes out of the fiber laser, goes through an isolator and two lenses before being steered in to the amplifier.  </p>



<h4 id="182125-11012016">18:21:25-11/01/2016</h4>

<p>Brian gave me some tips on starting up the TA, I am going to copy them into this document.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check your TA chip is OK by diode testing it. It should have a normal diode voltage drop in one direction and infinite resistance in the other direction</li>
<li>Mount the chip. The mount has x, y and z degrees of freedom. To change x, loosen the bolts through to the base and slide the mount. To change y, add aluminum foil underneath the mount. To change z, rotate the threaded lens mount.</li>
<li>Connect the current controller and temp controller. Set the temp controller at about 20C. Put the current controller at 0A.</li>
<li>For a 2W chip, do not go above 400mA without properly seeding the laser. Also avoid seeding the TA for long times without running current through the TA. Check the manufacturer spec for the max seed. Eagleyard should be 50mW max. We use 30-35mW usually. <br>
<ul><li>Adjust the spontaneous emission. It should be going straight backwards from the mount and level to the table.</li>
<li>Collimate the beam by using the lens mount z adjustment. It will probably have a wide horizontal halo. Ignore that and make the center bright part collimated.</li>
<li>Bring in your seed beam to the TA. It should be mode matched (collimated and the same size as the back reflection).</li></ul></li>
<li>You should be seeding the laser at this point. Optimize the output power at 400mA      current. You should aim for &gt;10mW output. Yes, you are getting out less than you put in.</li>
<li>Before doing any experiment (or anything with a potential for back reflection), put in an optical isolator. You will need it!</li>
<li>Carefully increase the current and plot the output power versus current. The curve will level off somewhere. Stop increasing current when it starts to level off. This is your max current.</li>
<li>The output spatial mode will look terrible. Good luck shaping it. If you’re putting it into a fiber, be careful not to burn the fiber. The TA spatial mode is a function of current, so you will need to constantly realign as you turn the TA current up.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended that a piece of the TA input seed and output power is simultaneously put into a fabry perot to determine if there the TA is causing feedback to the seed. An optical isolator on the input seed may be necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, very useful paper by Dan Steck <a href="http://steck.us/papers/ta.pdf">Steck TA paper</a></p>



<h1 id="1122016">1/12/2016</h1>

<p>I am trying to figure out how well my simulations compare to each other .  I have three types of simulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>coherent state evolution</li>
<li>fock state evolution</li>
<li>mean field</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now the mean field and fock state simulations comprae well, I think the issue is that the coherent evolution uses parameters which need to be scaled by factors of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1">\pi</script>.  I belive the correct scaling is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2">4 \pi c</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-3">c</script> is the dynamical evolution rate.</p>

<p>The public access to the program will be through a script which does all of the conversions, so users should not have to worry about this.  Right now I am working with simulations of about 5000 atoms as it is inconvenient to run coherent simulations for larger atom numbers.  I will run a large simulation while I try to align the TA and check back after lunch.</p>



<h4 id="102247-12012016">10:22:47-12/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now I am working on aligning the TA using instructions from yesterday.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wired up the temperature PID circuit and set it to 18.2 C.</li>
<li>TA current turned on, no spontaneous emission.  Checked connections and tried again, still no emission.  Need to turn off lights probably.  Turned off lights, weak emission, but there.</li>
<li>Moved mirrors back and aligned two pinholes to align beam from fiber laser into TA.</li>
</ol>



<h4 id="182337-12012016">18:23:37-12/01/2016</h4>

<p>TA is aligned and with minimal effor have 4mW of output power.  Going to mess with the telescope lense setup to try to optimze this.  Had to take the second lens off of a stage to get it to the right height.  Arne had the last two mirrors lower the light, I moved everything down to the same level.  We have 4.5 mw of power, lets turn up the power and see what we have.  We have put on the attenutator, so our initial reading is different</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we will optimize the beampath more, this is a bit lower than Arne measured on 06/28/2013, but not too bad.</p>



<h1 id="1132016">1/13/2016</h1>

<p>Played around with commenting the simulation code this morning, using a linter which enforces style guidelines, should make it easier for other people to use.</p>



<h4 id="100816-13012016">10:08:16-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Everything looks good with regards to temperature, pressure, and logging software.  Going to optimize the TA.  I moved the mirrors to be closer to the TA and re-aligned completely to save some space on the table.  I swapped out the mount for the second lens for a micrometer so I can do some finer adjustments.</p>



<h4 id="121616-13012016">12:16:16-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>TA is now partially aligned, after lunch I will get the power up.  Acquired GPIB to usb cable to hook up SRS630 thermocouple monitor to the computer for the bake. </p>



<h4 id="125647-13012016">12:56:47-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Got it back to where it was yesterday.  Will continue trying to optimize, then I will make a measurement of the power as a function of TA current.  </p>

<p>I have optimized as much as I could.  Power measured beyond TA with the FieldMate is 3.02mW with  ~29mW of input seed.  I now put in the optical isolator with 74% efficiency.    This isn’t great, I think I will tweak it up later.</p>

<p>Now we will make the power measurement:</p>

<p>This is not enough power, so we will optimize more at low power.  Power optimized.  When we set up the optics for the innolight laser we will need to partially re-align anyway.  </p>



<h4 id="141734-13012016">14:17:34-13/01/2016</h4>

<p>Now I will get the SRS630 thermocouple reader working.  It will interface with the same python program to push data to website.  </p>

<p>The reader is working and the data is now being stored on an influxdb/grafana workflow which is accessbile at <a href="jqi-logger.physics.umd.edu">JQI-Logger</a> which is a JQI wide timeseries monitoring database setup.  I will not keep passwords here, but there is a Python API for InfluxDB which allows easy data mongering.  </p>

<p>I screwed up when loading the old data into the database and converted timezones wrong, so the old data is recorded as six hours earlier than it actually is.  </p>



<h1 id="1142016">1/14/2016</h1>

<p>Today I will get the rest of the SFG system going as well as wipe and clean the old analysis computer to be used as a monitoring computer to free up serial ports on the laptop.</p>

<p>Cleaned up the SpinorBEC panel on Grafana so it now displays relevent statistics.</p>



<h4 id="101330-14012016">10:13:30-14/01/2016</h4>

<p>Need to properly optimize the two isolators in the TA part of the SFG system.  Aligning an isolator requires the following steps from the <a href="http://www.ofr.com/io_alignment.htm">OFR Website</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Remove protective tape from polatizor cells.</li>
<li>Place the isoltaor in the laser beam.  Place a detector &gt; 8” from the ouput polarizer.  Center the beam.</li>
<li>Loosen set screws on the polarizer cells.</li>
<li>Rotate the input polariztor until transmission is maximzed, thus aligning it to the laser’s plane of polarization.  Lock down its set screw.</li>
<li>Rotate the output polarizer until the transmission is maximized.  This should occur at 45 relative to the input plane of polarization.</li>
<li>Reverse the isolator and put the detector a few inches from the input polarizer.  Center the beam.</li>
<li>Adjust the output polarizer until the transmission is minimized (should only be 1-2 degrees).</li>
<li>Return the isolator to operating position.  Should now be ready to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>The model of isolators and expected transmission we are using are: <br>
* <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=4915">ThorLabs IO-2.5-1064-VLP</a>, expected transmission is 75% <br>
* EOT Isolator, expected transmission &gt; 90%</p>



<h4 id="140847-14012016">14:08:47-14/01/2016</h4>

<p>Had group meeting and lunch.  Removed the EOT isolator and am going to try to optimize TA again.   </p>

<p>Wrote documentation for the Simulation code I wrote as <a href="https://github.com/ZachGlassman/SpinorBECSimulation">Simulation Code</a>.</p>



<h4 id="193942-14012016">19:39:42-14/01/2016</h4>

<p>Aligned the TA again from scratch fixing the height.  </p>

<p>It turns out the system works better if the lenses are closer together than would be expected, however, at 401mW, I now have 6.3mW.  I am going to take data to see the trend.</p>

<p>I am going to tweak it up and bit, then call it for the night.</p>



<h1 id="1192016">1/19/2016</h1>

<p>Working on simulations to compare with Ryan.  For now I am <em>faking</em> negative q by using an imaginary magnetic field since <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-4">q</script> is just the term which is quadratic in the magnetic field.  This works as long as there is no linear shift.  Eventually it will be better to just work in terms of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5">q</script> anyway or at least be able to.</p>



<h4 id="104828-19012016">10:48:28-19/01/2016</h4>

<p>Alinging the TA.  At 400mA, I get about 7mW out of the TA.  I am going to try to make this better.  Not able to do much better in a short time. </p>

<p>Preparing for meeting with Ryan Wilson about the spinor evolution.</p>



<h4 id="165458-19012016">16:54:58-19/01/2016</h4>

<p>Had a long chat with Ryan Wilson, found that calculation for q was incorrect by factor of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6">(2\pi)^3</script> which is probably a momentum space integral.  Our calculations agree except for that.  I need to prepare plots of :</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial state distribution for truncated wigner</li>
<li>Long time evolution of coherent state.</li>
<li>Full simulation for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7">q=-5</script> </li>
</ul>

<p>Prepared these plots, they are shown below.  The first is the intial disttribution for TWA at 10k atoms and the second is a simulation of 10k atoms for -5q.  I think there might be a slight issue with the initial state preparation since the simulations should agree slightly better.</p>

<h1 id="1202016">1/20/2016</h1>

<p>Today I will try to do several things: <br>
* Make progress on cluster computations <br>
* Get TA aligned with new waveplate (should help power) <br>
* Set up temperature monitoring of the lab through Rasberry pi or arduino.</p>



<h4 id="110759-20012016">11:07:59-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>Set up the temperature monitor for the room with an arduino and an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1782">Adafruit MPC9808</a>.  </p>

<p>I now have cluster access to Deepthought2 and am going to spend the rest of the morning trying to get that working.</p>



<h4 id="142213-20012016">14:22:13-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>I put in the waveplate for the TA which helped the power a bit.  However, the power was wandering around by about .2mW over a timescale of minutes so I adjusted the telescope to see if I could improve that.  The output power at 400mA current is about 8mW now.</p>

<p>I took off the attenuator to get a better measurement and the TA is aligned to 10.8mW.  We are ready to proceed.  </p>

This should be good enough.</p>



<h4 id="165842-20012016">16:58:42-20/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have done everything I set out to do today.  I also ran a long time simulation is show below. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kJ0DHfKi52M/VqADNH-r4nI/AAAAAAAAG-8/S6_kPOqHBhE/s0/figure_1.png" alt="enter image description here" title="longtime1-20.png"></p>

<p>What is perhaps interesting is that both the single fock state and the TWA are great approximations for some period of time, but they each fail at long times.  It seems like only an incomplete description is needed for the first few oscillations.  This is quite good as it means we may not need a full cluster simulation even if the TWA does not work.</p>



<h1 id="1212016">1/21/2016</h1>

<p>Today I need to sort out my schedule for next semester and get the lab ready for the big snow storm.</p>

<p>Group meeting this morning with presentation by Carla about Quantum Imaging.</p>



<h4 id="123008-21012016">12:30:08-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>Hooked up thermocouple to the ion pump below the magnets which should give us an idea of the maximum temperature of the magnets.  It is something like 40 celsius.  So this should not be an issue at all.  As always ones can view the status at <a href="http://jqi-logger.physics.umd.edu/dashboard/db/spinorbec">JQI Logger</a>.  </p>



<h4 id="161731-21012016">16:17:31-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>Optimized the isolator at full 2A, was already close to what it should be.  Then re-aligned the TA at 2A.  The TA alignment is <em>strongly</em> dependant on the input current, thus final alignments must be done at full power.  I found I had to increase the distance between the telescope lens pair prior to the TA at 2A compared to 400mA.  </p>

<p>The procedure to align the isolator was to rotate the magnetic body until the part of the input beam reflected off the beam splitter on the input side from the incoming beam was minimized.  We will keep the TA alignment as is (~820 mW @ 2A with isolator) for now.</p>

<p>Next we will put in a prism pair and a spacial filter for beam shaping and cleaning.  The prism pair changes the beam height and it is not parallel to the table anymore.  The angle is between 1 and 2 degrees from the horizontal.</p>



<h4 id="192135-21012016">19:21:35-21/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have fixed this and put in the spatial filter, tomorrow I will align the spatial fiter.</p>

<p>I have updated the Fock State simulation by adding an adaptive stepsize ‘zvode’ method as opposed to a very simple fourth order Runge-Kutta method.  This should alleviate the need to choose a correct step size.  The advantage seems to be that there is no need to choose the step size and there is a benefit when using large atom numbers (&gt;25k), however at smaller atom numbers it seems to do many more steps than the really quite basic fourth order method I already implemented without any noticible increase in error.  At very small atom numbers, it also does better.  </p>

<p>The conclusion is that for any particular time step one chooses with the basic method there is a maximum atom number for which the propogation does not go unstable and a region where it is also faster than an adaptive time step method.  The adaptive time step is always stable, but can take longer times for some atom numbers.  I will have to do more testing, but it could be that using the adaptive algorithm is not as good as optimzing the step for a specific number.  This is unlike the TWA code in which the adaptive step size gave significant performance benefits.</p>



<h1 id="1222016">1/22/2016</h1>

<p>It is snowing, so I am working today on my simulations an attempting to get them to run on the cluster.  Unfortunately, my simulations rely on numba, which is a JIT compiler targeting llvm relying on a more updated version of python than is on the cluster.  I have spoken to the cluster admin to see if they can upgrade python, but for today, I will work on removing the dependancy. </p>



<h4 id="102300-22012016">10:23:00-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>Most of the time in the code is spend calculating the tridiagonal Hamtilonian for each <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">k</script> in the number of pairs basis at each time step.  This is done through a function called tri_ham which is written in a optimized for the JIT compiler, although also works without it.  I have profiled the function with and without the compiler to get </p>

<p>This the JIT gives a speedup of ~350 times.  Thus not using the compiler will render the code essentially useless.  For reference, here is the function we are considering</p>

<p>The goal for right now is to see if I can implement this same functionality using numpy such that I don’t lost speed and can then run easily on the supercomputer.  The dependencies are currently</p>

<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>numba</li>
<li>sys</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>tqdm</li>
<li>scipy</li>
</ul>

<p>However, all but numpy and scipy could be removed easily if I can get this function to be faster.</p>

<p>One preliminary solution has been obtained, which runs in 1.45ms, thus only a factor of 2-3 times slower than the JIT compiled code and only has numpy dependency.  </p>



<h4 id="123904-22012016">12:39:04-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>We also need to change the functions which compute expection values in a similiar manner.  For reference, here is the fast numpy only code for computing the tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrix elements.</p>

<p>All code seems to produce equivalent answers and is certainly equivalent mathematically, however, it appears that there is some difference due to machine precision.  After some testing, it appears this difference is acceptable.  </p>

<p>The top graph is both evolutions over time for 4000 atoms and the bottom is a histogram of the error.  Since the error is in the 1e-11 range as compared to populations of thousands, this is perfectly acceptable.</p>



<h4 id="132413-22012016">13:24:13-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>This code is now ready to run on the cluster.  The only further optimization that could be done is to use a faster numerical integration algorithm.  I will spend a bit investigating the scipy ode library to see if I can improve this.</p>



<h4 id="163916-22012016">16:39:16-22/01/2016</h4>

<p>I have finished with the code for the cluster, my first try is run a bunch of separate fock state simulations with different <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-10">q</script> to see if anything interesting comes up, and then compare to the mean field at these values.  Using the cluster is somewhat difficult, but I will share what I have learned so far</p>

<ul>
<li>To submit a bunch of jobs, use the bash scripting language to loop over the job submission command.</li>
<li>Python support on the cluster is very poor, I will need to work on installing packages myself, however, I found that by loading the module in the workspace, I was able to more easily load the modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>I ran seven jobs and used 18 seconds of total computing time.  None of them worked completely as I still have not gotten the syntax down.  I believe it has to do with using outdated packages.  I have put in a request for the IT division to update the python packages.  I will be trying more soon.</p>

<p>I will set up some simulations to run on my work computer over the weekend.</p>



<h1 id="1252016">1/25/2016</h1>

<p>Worked on merging the lab notebooks, spent most of the day shoveling my car out of storm Jonas.  Started running simulation for full 40k atoms, should finish by tomorrow.  Also go an email that the cluster is updating the python distribution in the next week or so.  Should be good to run soon.</p>



<h1 id="1262016">1/26/2016</h1>

<p>Finished the full simulation for 40k atoms, the results are here <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lWmkdKHVC30/Vqee96U3NvI/AAAAAAAAHA4/1nmRMDTu02A/s0/40k1s.png" alt="enter image description here" title="40k1s.png"></p>

<p>Compared to the 10k simulation, the fock state and hte coherent state agreement is much better.  The averaging here is not so good (mag, atom loop only 5) so it would be nice to see after a cluster run if averaging over more states helped.  This simulation took ~23 hours so it would not be feasible to run anything larger on my desk computer.</p>



<h4 id="165351-26012016">16:53:51-26/01/2016</h4>

<p>Wrote the fock state simulation in C++, getting about 15-25% speed improvments which is quite good.</p>

<p>The cluster website is down, but I am attempting to run some code on it.  </p>



<h4 id="171844-26012016">17:18:44-26/01/2016</h4>

<p>First successful cluster run.  Issue was module python must be loaded before the application is run.  First run took 2:23 and it worked.  I will start thinking about the best way to continue using it.  </p>

<p>After all day, I used an additional 5:35 of computing time.  Now that I have the system figured out, I will set up a longer simulation before running more code.</p>



<h1 id="1292016">1/29/2016</h1>

<p>I have been working on the DAMOP abstract for the past few days in addition to collecting data on the spinor simulations.  I will present some of the hightlights here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed coherent state and fock state simulation agreement, which is now quite excellent as shown in the following plot<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IoN-o9jTwjE/Vqu5ddV2mrI/AAAAAAAAHJA/SmT2av9IDJg/s0/comparefock_coh.png" alt="enter image description here" title="comparefock_coh.png">  This plot also shows the current issue which is not yet resolved, namely that the TWA simulations (designated as mean field here) are not in great agreement.  Really, they should match almost exactly for at least a period.</li>
<li>Ran simulations for the microwave reversal pulses in the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-11">F=1</script> condensate.  These did produce some nice results. <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2Ao7wgllHEU/Vqu7LvhlYKI/AAAAAAAAHJQ/sxVwD23MWLg/s0/q_n5_pulses.png" alt="enter image description here" title="q_n5_pulses.png">  </li>
<li>We can also look at the calculation of these minimia and their dependence on the initial time of the pulse. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KPU4zq3r1s4/Vqu7awhQM-I/AAAAAAAAHJc/b3PC_kj5jyo/s0/q_n5_times.png" alt="enter image description here" title="q_n5_times.png"></li>
<li>Lastly we found a definite optimal pulse power for the optimal time.<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jBfE6RDdS-0/Vqu7r5FcG7I/AAAAAAAAHJo/BrN_9pXxsm4/s0/microwave_norm.png" alt="enter image description here" title="microwave_norm.png">  Each color represents a different initial time for the microwave pulse and its clear the for each initial time, the optimal reversal phase is essentially the same.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="150622-29012016">15:06:22-29/01/2016</h4>

<p>I am going to work on aligning the spatial filter after the prism pair.  the biggest issue that the beam is not parallel to the table, I am hoping it is close enough that the spatial filtering is useful.  Procedure will be :</p>

<ol>
<li>Align the beam through the stage without the lens or the pinhole installed. </li>
<li>Install the lens and align to the beam.</li>
<li>Insert the pinhole past the focus of the lens and align.</li>
</ol>

<p>I changed the stage of the prism pair so that it is better supported.</p>



<h1 id="212016">2/1/2016</h1>

<p>The morning I did some simulations for Don to compare his results with and went to the JQI seminar.  Now back to aligning the repump laser system.  I have put in a Melles Griot prism pair which is causing some issues, I am going to change the mount on the spatial filter to one which is height adjustable and hope this helps.</p>



<h4 id="144230-01022016">14:42:30-01/02/2016</h4>

<p>I changed the mount on the spatial filter and modified the assembly for the prism pair which seems to help significantly.  The issue is that the height of the beam is so low that I cannot use an adjustable base, so I can only add small spacers to make the height changes.</p>

<p>We do not have any of the correct microscope objectives for this wavelength, so we will proceed without the spatial filter and then put it in retroactively.  </p>

<p>I need to expand and collimate the beam coming out of the innolight laser.  According to Don’s notebook I need 2.152A to get lasing.</p>

<p>Everything is aligned, I need to find a power meter so I can optimize the waveplates and the isolator.  then I should be able to send everything into the fiber.</p>



<h1 id="222016">2/2/2016</h1>

<p>Looking into the code for our data monitoring, I would like to make a few improvments, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Within each process thread which runs analysis scripts, spawn new process to leverage cpu cores better.  Cap number of running processes and make sure they actually end.  Possibly use zprocess (from Lincoln Turner’s group)</li>
<li>Abstract routines making them easier to write (some ideas on this below)</li>
<li>Switch to hdf5 file format for saving images with run information</li>
<li>Set up local server to store non-image data (save path to images in database, file system is correct place to store image data)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some thoughts on routine abstractions: <br>
A routine is composed of three tasks: <br>
1. Aquiring data and parameters <br>
2. Performing actions aquired data and parameters <br>
3. Returning results</p>

<p>The main thread should not care or know about anything to do with 2 and only needs to know a priori about the type of results returned.  Lets make the further limiting assumption that data will always be in the form on a numpy array (numerical values) in some dimension and that parameters can be represented as a dictionary.    </p>

<p>So we have a Procedure class which needs to expose to the GUI the input parameters and their types and the return dictionary with types.  Lets also assume for now that the return dictionary will be composed of parameters bound to numerical arrays.  </p>

<p>Parameters need to be divided into user input and program input, by this I mean input that needs to come directly from the user (although can and will be initialized with reasonable defaults) such as fitting parameters as opposed to parameters that come from the program such as index name.  </p>

<p>User will generate procedure objects in one of two ways: <br>
1. Subclassing Procedure and adding things themselves (probably preferred way for control) <br>
2. Creating routine for data processing and using helper functions within Procedure class to instantiate without subclassing</p>

<p>User will be able to specify procedures to load in the configuration procedure on start, or load them in dynamically.</p>

<p>We have some issues with the SFG system alignment, namely that we need more room to put in the telescope system and the spatial filter system.  The problem is that the heights of the TA and the innolight laser are not the same, so the beams must be raised and lowered. </p>

<p>I am moving the TA back a few inches and re-aligning it so we can have the option of putting in a spatial filter later.  Doing same alignment procedure as before, I have not touched anything until the mirrors before the TA, so the lens pair and isolator should still be aligned.</p>

<p>Moved everything back and have the TA producing power, but not very much.  Need to tweak it up for the rest of the day. </p>

<p>Back aligned, getting 992 mA at 2A of current.  Put in the lens system to alter the beam diameter into the fiber.  </p>

<p>Now I am using a power meter to optimize the waveplate-isolator-waveplate grouping after the innolight laser for maximum power.  Borrowed it from Gretchen’s Strontium lab, they need it back before tomorrow morning.  Its not rated for the right wavelength, but it gives me some very insensitive measurement.  Its good enough to align the isolator.</p>

<p>The system relies on a dichroic optic which transmits 1319nm and reflects 1064nm light, however, there is some reflection from the 1319nm beam on the first setup attempt.  This is probably because the optic needs to be at 45 degrees and it is not.  I will adjust the optic until the reflection is minimal and then realign other beam path. <br>
The following is the properties of the mirror we are using</p>
