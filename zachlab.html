<p>This is the first entry in the markdown lab notebook, we are going to see if we like it.  First thing to do is check the temperatures and the pressures.  Of course this can also be seen on <a href="http://lettspinorlab.github.io/">LettSpinorLab</a> live.  Everything looks good in terms of the circulator outside.</p>

<p>I did not change any of the variacs.  For the rest of the day, I will figure out how to get this lab notebook operational and also work on my simulations.  When I make more measurements, I will add them to the above table.</p>



<h1 id="1112016">1/11/2016</h1>

<p>Today I again checked the temperature and pressure, the temperatures were the same as before, but the Pressure was 1.7E-8 and the ion pump current was 2.6E-5 at 9:31am.  </p>

<p>Now we will be aligning the sfg system. </p>

<p>We have plugged all the laser power cords into the blue plugs.  Now I will align the TA.  Some notes for setting up the NPPhotonics fiber laser </p>

<ul>
<li>Must select FLM-0107</li>
<li>Must select Rev B</li>
</ul>

<p>After turning on the laser,, we didnâ€™t see any power, so changed fibers to one with green tips on it, PM90-XP.  We were previously using blue tipped fiber.  Output at first is 49.31mW. </p>

<p>Aligning the SFG system.  First thing to do is align the Tapered Amplifier.  The light comes out of the fiber laser, goes through an isolator and two lenses before being steered in to the amplifier.  A few things to figure out</p>

<ul>
<li>The height of the optics is above the tapered amplifier and I have not changed them, was the beam simply steered down before, or am I missing something? </li>
<li>What is the best way to align a TA?  It can be very harmful to send light into it without current and also to send current without light, so what is proper?</li>
<li>Is the distance between the lenses supposed to be a telescope or is it supposed to focus the light into the TA?  I think it is probably a telescope since there is already a focusing lens built into the TA.</li>
</ul></div></body>
